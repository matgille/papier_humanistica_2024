                <p>In this tutorial, you will first learn the basics of Markdown—an easy to
read and write markup syntax for plain text—as well as
<ref target="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</ref>, a command line tool that
converts plain text into a number of beautifully formatted file types:
PDF, .docx, HTML, LaTeX, slide decks, and more.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_1"/> With Pandoc
as your digital typesetting tool, you can use Markdown syntax to add
figures, a bibliography, formatting, and easily change citation styles
from Chicago to MLA (for instance), all using plain text.</p>
                <p>The tutorial assumes no prior technical knowledge, but it scales with
experience, as we often suggest more advanced techniques towards the end
of each section. These are clearly marked and can be revisited after
some practice and experimentation.</p>
                <p>Instead of following this tutorial in a mechanical way, we recommend you
strive to understand the solutions offered here as a <emph>methodology</emph>,
which may need to be tailored further to fit your environment and
workflow. The installation of the necessary tools presents perhaps the
biggest barrier to participation. Allot yourself enough time and
patience to install everything properly, or do it with a colleague who
has a similar set-up and help each other out. Consult the <ref target="#useful-resources">Useful
Resources</ref> section below if you get
stuck.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_2"/>

                <p>Writing, storing, and retrieving documents are activities central to the
humanities research workflow. And yet, many authors base their practice
on proprietary tools and formats that sometimes fall short of even the
most basic requirements of scholarly writing. Perhaps you can relate to
being frustrated by the fragility of footnotes, bibliographies, figures,
and book drafts authored in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Nevertheless,
most journals still insist on submissions in .docx format.</p>
                <p>More than causing personal frustration, this reliance on proprietary
tools and formats has long-term negative implications for the academic
community. In such an environment, journals must outsource typesetting,
alienating authors from the material contexts of publication and adding
further unnecessary barriers to the unfettered circulation of
knowledge.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_3"/>
                </p>
                <p>When you use MS Word, Google Docs, or Open Office to write documents,
what you see is not what you get. Beneath the visible layer of words,
sentences, and paragraphs lies a complicated layer of code
understandable only to machines. Because of that hidden layer, your
.docx and .pdf files depend on proprietary tools to be rendered
correctly. Such documents are difficult to search, to print, and to
convert into other file formats.</p>
                <p>Moreover, time spent formatting your document in MS Word or Open Office
is wasted, because all that formatting is removed by the publisher
during submission. Both authors and publishers would benefit from
exchanging files with minimal formatting, leaving the typesetting to the
final typesetting stage of the publishing process.</p>
                <p>This is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic
elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The
idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles,
sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least,
your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor
you are currently using stops working or "goes out of business."</p>
                <p>Writing in this way liberates the author from the tool. Markdown can be
written in any plain text editor and offers a rich ecosystem of software
that can render that text into beautiful looking documents. For this
reason, Markdown is currently enjoying a period of growth, not just as
as means for writing scholarly papers but as a convention for online
editing in general.</p>
                <p>Popular general purpose plain text editors include <ref target="https://atom.io/">Atom</ref>
(all platforms) and <ref target="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</ref> (Windows only).</p>
                <p>It is important to understand that Markdown is merely a convention.
Markdown files are stored as plain text, further adding to the
flexibility of the format. Plain text files have been around since the
electronic typewriter. The longevity of this standard inherently makes
plain text more sustainable and stable than proprietary formats. While
files produced even ten years ago in Microsoft Word and Apple's Pages
can cause significant problems when opened with the latest version, it
is still possible to open a file written in any number of "dead" plain
text editors from the past several decades: AlphaPlus, Perfect Writer,
Text Wizard, Spellbinder, WordStar, or Isaac Asimov's favorite SCRIPSIT
2.0, made by Radio Shack. Writing in plain text guarantees that your
files will remain readable ten, fifteen, twenty years from now. In this
tutorial, we outline a workflow that frees the researcher from
proprietary word processing software and fragile file formats.</p>
                <p>It is now possible to write a wide range of documents in one
format—articles, blog posts, wikis, syllabi, and recommendation
letters—using the same set of tools and techniques to search, discover,
backup, and distribute our materials. Your notes, blog entries, code
documentation, and wikis can all be authored in Markdown. Increasingly,
many platforms like WordPress, Reddit, and GitHub support Markdown
authorship natively. In the long term, your research will benefit from
such unified workflows, making it easier to save, search, share, and
organize your materials.</p>

                <head>Principles</head>
                <p>Inspired by best practices in a variety of disciplines, we were guided
by the following principles:</p>
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <emph>Sustainability.</emph> Plain text both ensures transparency and answers
the standards of long-term preservation. MS Word may go the way of
Word Perfect in the future, but plain text will always remain easy
to read, catalog, mine, and transform. Furthermore, plain text
enables easy and powerful versioning of the document, which is
useful in collaboration and organizing drafts. Your plain text files
will be accessible on cell phones, tablets, or, perhaps, on a
low-powered terminal in some remote library. Plain text is backwards
compatible and future-proof. Whatever software or hardware comes
along next, it will be able to understand your plain text files.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <emph>Preference for human-readable formats.</emph> When writing in Word or
Google Docs, what you see is not what you get. The .doc file
contains hidden, automatically-generated formatting characters,
creating an obfuscated typesetting layer that is difficult for the
user to troubleshoot. Something as simple as pasting an image or
text from the browser can have unpredictable effects on your
document's formatting.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <emph>Separation of form and content.</emph> Writing and formatting at the same
time is distracting. The idea is to write first, and format later,
as close as possible to the time of publication. A task like
switching from Chicago to MLA formatting should be painless. Journal
editors who want to save time on needless formatting and copy
editing should be able to provide their authors with a formatting
template which takes care of the typesetting minutia.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <emph>Support for the academic apparatus.</emph> The workflow needs to handle
footnotes, figures, international characters, and bibliographies
gracefully.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <emph>Platform independence.</emph> As the vectors of publication multiply, we
need to be able to generate a multiplicity of formats including for
slide projection, print, web, and mobile. Ideally, we would like to
be able to generate the most common formats without breaking
bibliographic dependencies. Our workflow needs to be portable as
well–it would be nice to be able to copy a folder to a thumbdrive
and know that it contains everything needed for publication. Writing
in plain text means you can easily share, edit, and archive your
documents in virtually any environment. For example, a syllabus
written in Markdown can be saved as a PDF, printed as a handout, and
converted into HTML for the web, all from the same file. Both web
and print documents should be published from the same source and
look similar, preserving the logical layout of the material.</p>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>Markdown and LaTeX answer all of these requirements. We chose Markdown
(and not LaTeX) because it offers the most light-weight and clutter free
syntax (hence, mark <emph>down</emph>) and because when coupled with Pandoc it
allows for the greatest flexibility in outputs (including .docx and .tex
files).<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_5"/>

system-bound details of installing the software listed below. For
example, it makes no sense to provide installation instructions for
LaTeX, when the canonical online instructions for your operating system
will always remain more current and more complete. Similarly, the

instructions. Pandoc was created and is maintained by John
MacFarlane, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California,
Berkeley. This is humanities computing at its best and will serve as
the engine of our workflow. With Pandoc, you will be able to compile
text and bibliography into beautifully formatted and flexible
documents. Once you've followed the installation instructions,
verify that Pandoc is installed by entering <code rend="inline">pandoc --version</code> into
the command line. We assume that you have at least version 1.12.3,
released in January 2014.</p>

                <head>Markdown Basics</head>
                <p>Markdown is a convention for structuring your plain-text documents
semantically. The idea is to identify logical structures in your
document (a title, sections, subsections, footnotes, etc.), mark them
with some unobtrusive characters, and then "compile" the resulting text
with a typesetting interpreter which will format the document
consistently, according to a specified style.</p>
                <p>Markdown conventions come in several "flavors" designed for use in
particular contexts, such as blogs, wikis, or code repositories. The
flavor of Markdown used by Pandoc is geared for academic use. Its
conventions are described on the <ref target="http://pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc's
Markdown</ref>
page. Its conventions include the <ref target="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#yaml-metadata-block">"YAML"
block</ref>,
which contains some useful metadata.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_ft-1"/>
                </p>
                <p>Let's now create a simple document in Markdown. Open a plain-text editor
of your choice and begin typing. It should look like this:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_0" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_0.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Pandoc-flavored Markdown stores each of the above values, and "prints"
them in the appropriate location of your outputted document once you are
ready to typeset. We will later learn to add other, more powerful fields
to the YAML block. For now, let's pretend we are writing a paper that
contains three sections, each subdivided into two subsections. Leave a
blank line after last three dashes in the YAML block and paste the
following:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_1" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_1.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Go ahead and enter some dummy text as well. Empty space is meaningful in
Markdown: do not indent your paragraphs. Instead, separate paragraphs by
using an blank line. Blank lines must also precede section headers.</p>
                <p>You can use asterisks to add bold or italicized emphasis to your words,
like this: <code rend="inline">*italics*</code> and <code rend="inline">**bold**</code>. We should also add a link and a
footnote to our text to cover the basic components of an average paper.
Type:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_2" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_2.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>When the text of the link and the address are the same it is faster to
write <code rend="inline">&lt;www.eff.org&gt;</code> instead of <code rend="inline">[www.eff.org](www.eff.org)</code>.</p>
                <p>Let's save our file before advancing any further. Create a new folder
that will house this project. You are likely to have some system of
organizing your documents, projects, illustrations, and bibliographies.
But often, your document, its illustrations, and bibliography live in
different folders, which makes them hard to track. Our goal is to create
a single folder for each project, with all relevant materials included.
The general rule of thumb is one project, one paper, one folder. Name
your file something like <code rend="inline">main.md</code>, where "md" stands for markdown.</p>
                <p>Once your file is saved, let's add an illustration. Copy an image (any
small image) to your folder, and add the following somewhere in the body
of the text: <code rend="inline">![image caption](your_image.jpg)</code>.</p>
                <p>At this point, your <code rend="inline">main.md</code> should look something like the following.
You can download this sample .md file
<ref target="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/gh-pages/assets/sample.md">here</ref>.</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_3" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_3.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>As we shall do shortly, this plain text file can be rendered as a very
nice PDF:</p>
                <figure>
                    <desc>Screen shot of PDF rendered by Pandoc</desc>
                    <graphic url="Screen-Shot-2014-11-06.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>If you'd like to get an idea of how this kind of markup will be
interpreted as HTML formatting, try <ref target="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">this online
sandbox</ref> and play
around with various kinds of syntax. Remember that certain elements of
<emph>Pandoc</emph>-flavored Markdown (such as the title block and footnotes) will
not work in this web form, which only accepts the basics.</p>
                <p>At this point, you should spend some time exploring some of other
features of Markdown like quotations (referenced by <code rend="inline">&gt;</code> symbol), bullet
lists which start with <code rend="inline">*</code> or <code rend="inline">-</code>, verbatim line breaks which start with
<code rend="inline">|</code> (useful for poetry), tables, and a few of the other functions listed
on Pandoc's markdown page.</p>
                <p>Pay particular attention to empty space and the flow of paragraphs. The
documentation puts it succinctly when it defines a paragraph to be "one
or more lines of text followed by one or more blank line." Note that
"newlines are treated as spaces" and that "if you need a hard line
break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line." The best way to
understand what that means is to experiment freely. Use your editor's
preview mode or just run Pandoc to see the results of your experiments.</p>
                <p>Above all, avoid the urge to format. Remember that you are identifying
<emph>semantic</emph> units: sections, subsections, emphasis, footnotes, and
figures. Even <code rend="inline">*italics*</code> and <code rend="inline">**bold**</code> in Markdown are not really
formatting marks, but indicate different level of <emph>emphasis</emph>. The
formatting will happen later, once you know the venue and the
requirements of publication.</p>
                <p>There are programs that allow you to watch a live preview of Markdown
output as you edit your plain text file, which we detail below in the
Useful Resources section. Few of them support footnotes, figures, and
bibliographies however. To take full advantage of Pandoc, we recommend
that you stick with simple, plain text files stored locally, on your
computer.</p>

                <p>Before we can start publishing our <code rend="inline">main.md</code> file into other formats, we
need to get oriented with working on the command line using your
computer's terminal program, which is the only (and best) way to use
Pandoc.</p>
                <p>The command line is a friendly place, once you get used to it. If you
are already familiar with using the command line, feel free to skip this
section. For others, it is important to understand that being able to
use your terminal program directly will all you to use a broad range of
powerful research tools that you couldn't use otherwise, and can serve
as a basis for more advanced work. For the purposes of this tutorial,
you need to learn only a few, very simple commands.</p>
                <p>First, open a command line window. If you are using macOS, open the Terminal
application in the 'Applications/Utilities' directory. On Windows, we
recommend you use PowerShell or, for a more robust solution, install the
Windows Subsystem for Linux and use the terminal that comes with your favorite
Linux distribution. For an excellent introduction to the command line, consult
"<ref target="/en/lessons/intro-to-bash">Introduction to the Bash Command
Line</ref>" by Ian
Milligan and James Baker.</p>
                <p>In the terminal, you should see a text window and a prompt that looks
something like this: <code rend="inline">computer-name:~username$</code>. The tilde indicates your
"home" directory, and in fact you can type <code rend="inline">$ cd ~</code> at any point to return to
your home directory. Don't type the dollar sign, it just symbolizes the
command prompt of your terminal, prompting you to type something into your
terminal (as opposed to typing it into your document); remember to hit enter
after every command.</p>
                <p>It is very likely that your "Documents" folder is located here. Type
<code rend="inline">$ pwd</code> (= print working directory) and press enter to display the name
of the current directory). Use <code rend="inline">$ pwd</code> whenever you feel lost.</p>
                <p>The command <code rend="inline">$ ls</code> (= list), which simply lists the files in the current
directory. Finally, you can use <code rend="inline">$ cd&gt;</code> (= change directory) like
<code rend="inline">$ cd DIRECTORY_NAME</code> (where <code rend="inline">DIRECTORY_NAME</code> is the name of the
directory you'd like to navigate to). You can use <code rend="inline">$ cd ..</code> to
automatically move up one level in the directory structure (the parent
directory of the directory you are currently in). Once you start typing
the directory name, use the Tab key to auto complete the
text—particularly useful for long directory names, or directories names
that contain spaces.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_6"/>
                </p>
                <p>These three terminal commands: <code rend="inline">pwd</code>, <code rend="inline">ls</code>, and <code rend="inline">cd</code> are all you need
for this tutorial. Practice them for a few minutes to navigate your
documents folder and think about they way you have organized your files.
If you'd like, follow along with your regular graphical file manager to
keep your bearings.</p>

                <head>Using Pandoc to convert Markdown to an MS Word document</head>
                <p>We are now ready to typeset! Open your terminal window, use <code rend="inline">$ pwd</code> and
<code rend="inline">$ cd DIRECTORY-NAME</code> to navigate to the correct folder for your project. Once you are
there, type <code rend="inline">$ ls</code> in the terminal to list the files. If you see your
.md file and your images, you are in the right place. To convert .md
into .docx type:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_4" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_4.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Open the file with MS Word to check your results. Alternatively, if you
use Open- or LibreOffice you can run:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_5" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_5.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>If you are new to the command line, imagine reading the above command as saying something like:
"Pandoc, create an MS Word file out of my Markdown file." The <code rend="inline">-o</code> part is a "flag," which in
this case says something like "instead of me explicitly telling you the source and the target
file formats, just guess by looking at the file extension" or simply "output." Many options are
available through such flags in Pandoc. You can see the complete list on <ref target="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc's
website</ref> or by typing <code rend="inline">$ man pandoc</code> in the
terminal.</p>
                <p>Try running the command</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_6" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_6.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Now navigate back to your project directory. Can you tell what happened?</p>
                <p>More advanced users who have LaTeX installed may want to experiment by
converting Markdown into .tex or specially formatted .pdf files. Once
LaTeX is installed, a beautifully formatted PDF file can be created
using the same command structure:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_7" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_7.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>If your document is written in languages other than English, you will likely need to use
the XeLaTeX engine instead of plain LaTeX for .pdf conversion:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_8" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_8.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Make sure your text editor supports the UTF-8 encoding. When using XeLaTeX for
conversion into .pdf, instead of the <code rend="inline">fontfamily</code> attribute in YAML to change
fonts, specify the <code rend="inline">mainfont</code> attribute, to produce something like the
following:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_9" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_9.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>
                    <note xml:id="note_ft-1"> Note that YAML often replicates some, although not all, of the</note>
command line argument (flag) functionality.  For example, font styles could
be passed to Pandoc in the form of <code rend="inline">pandoc main.md --mainfont=times -o target.pdf</code>. However, we prefer to use the YAML header options whenever
possible, since it makes our command line incantations easier to type and to
remember. Using a version control tool such as Git will preserve your YAML
changes, where what you type in the terminal is rather more ephemeral. Consult
the Templates section in the Pandoc manual (<code rend="inline">man pandoc</code>) for the list of
available YAML variables.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="2">
                <head>Working with Bibliographies</head>
                <p>In this section, we will add a bibliography to our document and then
convert from Chicago to MLA formats.</p>
                <p>If you are not using a reference manger like Endnote or Zotero, you
should. We prefer Zotero, because, like Pandoc, it was created by the
academic community and like other open-source projects it is released
under the GNU General Public License. Most importantly for us, your
reference manager must have the ability to generate bibliographies in
plain text format, to keep in line with our "everything in plain text"
principle. Go ahead and open a reference manager of your choice and add
some sample entries. When you are ready, find the option to export your
bibliography in BibTeX (.bib) format. Save your .bib file in your
project directory, and give it a reasonable title like "project.bib".</p>
                <p>The general idea is to keep your sources organized under one centralized
bibliographic database, while generating specific and much smaller .bib
files that will live in the same directory as your project. Go ahead and
open your .bib file with the plain-text editor of your choice.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_4"/>
                </p>
                <p>Your .bib file should contain multiple entries that look something like
this:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_10" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_10.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>You will rarely have to edit these by hand (although you can). In most
cases, you will simply "export" the .bib file from Zotero or from a
similar reference manager. Take a moment to orient yourself here. Each
entry consists of a document type, "article" in our case, a unique
identifier (fyfe_digital_2011), and the relevant meta-data on title,
volume, author, and so on. The thing we care most about is the unique ID
which immediately follows the curly bracket in the first line of each
entry. The unique ID is what allows us to connect the bibliography with
the main document. Leave this file open for now and go back to your
<code rend="inline">main.md</code> file.</p>
                <p>Edit the footnote in the first line of your <code rend="inline">main.md</code> file to look
something like the following examples, where <code rend="inline">@name_title_date</code> can be replaced with one of
the unique IDs from your <code rend="inline">project.bib</code> file.</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>
                        <code rend="inline">A reference formatted like this will render properly as inline- or footnote- style citation [@name_title_date, 67].</code>
                        <ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_7"/>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <code rend="inline">"For citations within quotes, put the comma outside the quotation mark" [@name_title_2011, 67].</code>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>Once we run the markdown through Pandoc, "@fyfe_digital_2011" will be
expanded to a full citation in the style of your choice. You can use the
<code rend="inline">@citation</code> syntax in any way you see fit: in-line with your text or in
the footnotes. To generate a bibliography simply include a section
called <code rend="inline"># Bibliography</code> at the end of document.</p>
                <p>Now, go back to your metadata header at the top of your .md document,
and specify the bibliography file to be used, like so:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_11" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_11.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>This tells Pandoc to look for your bibliography in the <code rend="inline">project.bib</code>
file, under the same directory as your <code rend="inline">main.md</code>. Let's see if this
works. Save your file, switch to the terminal window and run:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_12" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_12.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>The "citeproc" filter will parse any citation tags found in your document. The result
should be a decently formatted MS Word file. If you have LaTeX installed, convert into .pdf
using the same syntax for prettier results. Do not worry if things are not exactly the way you
like them---remember, you are going to fine-tune the formatting all at once and at later time,
as close as possible to the time of publication. For now we are just creating drafts based on
reasonable defaults.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="2">
                <head>Changing citation styles</head>
                <p>The default citation style in Pandoc is Chicago Author-date. We can
specify a different style by using stylesheet, written in the "Citation
Style Language" (yet another plain-text convention, in this case for
describing citation styles) and denoted by the .csl file extension.
Luckily, the CSL project maintains a repository of common citation
styles, some even tailored for specific journals. Visit
<ref target="http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/">http://editor.citationstyles.org/about/</ref> to find the .csl file for
Modern Language Association, download <code rend="inline">modern-language-association.csl</code>,
and save to your project directory as <code rend="inline">mla.csl</code>. Now we need to tell
Pandoc to use the MLA stylesheet instead of the default Chicago. We do
this by updating the YAML header:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_13" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_13.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>You then repeat the pandoc incantation to cast your markdown file into your target format (.pdf
or .docx):</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_14" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_14.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Parse the command into English as you are typing. In my head, I translate the above into
something like: "Pandoc, take the my markdown file, run it through a citation filter, and
output a Markdown file." As you get more familiar with citation stylesheets, consider adding
your custom-tailored .csl files for journals in your field to the archive as a service to the
community.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="2">
                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>You should now be able to write papers in Markdown, to create drafts in
multiple formats, to add bibliographies, and to easily change citation
styles. A final look at the project directory will reveal a number of
"source" files: your <code rend="inline">main.md</code> file, <code rend="inline">project.bib</code> file, your <code rend="inline">mla.csl</code>
file, and some images. Besides the source files you should see some some
"target" files that we created during the tutorial: <code rend="inline">main.docx</code> or
<code rend="inline">main.pdf</code>. Your folder should look something like this:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_15" corresp="code_sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown_15.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Treat you source files as an authoritative version of your text, and you
target files as disposable "print outs" that you can easily generate
with Pandoc on the fly. All revisions should go into <code rend="inline">main.md</code>. The
<code rend="inline">main.docx</code> file is there for final-stage clean up and formatting. For
example, if the journal requires double-spaced manuscripts, you can
quickly double-space in Open Office or Microsoft Word. But don't spend
too much time formatting. Remember, it all gets stripped out when your
manuscript goes to print. The time spent on needless formatting can be
put to better use in polishing the prose of your draft.</p>
