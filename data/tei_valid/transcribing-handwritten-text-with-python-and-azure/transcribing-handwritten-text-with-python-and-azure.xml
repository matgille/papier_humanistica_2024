                <head>Introducing Automated Transcription</head>
                <p>Handwritten documents are appealing artifacts and a mainstay of research for many historians. Sources such as diaries, letters, logbooks and reports connect historians to writers not only through the writer's words, but also through their individual writing style. However, research involving large amounts of these documents represents a significant challenge: transcription of documents into digital form makes them more searchable, but hand transcription is very time-consuming. While historians have been able to digitize physical typewritten documents using <ref target="https://perma.cc/JKU7-CH6Q">optical character recognition</ref> (OCR), handwriting, with its individual styles, has until recently resisted recognition by computers.</p>
                <p>Digitally transcribing symbols, whether typed, printed or written, is a form of pattern matching. OCR for typed characters recognizes the patterns that make up a letter through a set of codified rules. In order to gain the ability to recognize handwriting using deep learning, the computer goes through a special training process. It is fed a large number of images of written letters – for example, the letter A – along with data telling the computer which letter it is being shown. Throughout this training, the computer learns to recognize various similar visual patterns of a written A and differentiates them from other letters. This training process requires carefully classifying a lot of data and demands a substantial amount of computer processing. This is a specialized and labour-intensive process. It is also important to note that a recognition model based on deep learning reflects the biases both from the data it was trained on and from the ways in which this data was selected.</p>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Commercial Transcription Services</head>
                    <p>While training a customized handwriting recognition model is possible and sometimes required, it remains very difficult. Fortunately, ready-trained handwriting recognition services are available commercially. <ref target="https://perma.cc/YD7L-9CEZ">Microsoft</ref>, <ref target="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/handwriting">Google Cloud Platform</ref> and <ref target="https://aws.amazon.com/textract/">Amazon Web Services</ref> are companies that offer handwriting recognition services over the web. These services equip the historian who would like a faster means to transcribe handwritten documents, as long as these documents are legible and in a writing system that is recognizable by the service.</p>
                    <p>These commercially based services perform more reliably with legible handwriting in a standardized presentation, such as being written on straight lines. The services all recognize the roman alphabet, and certain services (but not all) also support other forms of writing, like the Arabic alphabet. You can check which languages each service supports on the following pages: <ref target="https://perma.cc/2T5M-DT2Y">Microsoft</ref>, <ref target="https://perma.cc/5TVV-5GP2">Google Cloud Platform</ref> and <ref target="https://perma.cc/V6KN-VPL3">Amazon Web Services</ref>. Automated transcription will also struggle to recognize handwriting that is only lightly visible, such as pencil, or otherwise poorly contrasted. Despite these limitations, however, handwriting recognition is now a useful and practical tool for historians who need to transcribe documents.</p>

                    <head>On Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services</head>
                    <p>For this lesson, we will use Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services to transcribe handwriting. Azure Cognitive Services is accessed only over the web – it is not a desktop application on your computer. Your computer connects to it and sends it images to process for handwriting recognition. Azure Cognitive Services replies with the text it detects in an image. Azure Cognitive Services performs reliably with handwritten documents and, based on personal usage, it performs as well as Google or Amazon Web Services on documents written in English and French. Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services has a free tier of service available.</p>
                    <p>Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services can be harnessed to transcribe typed text, handwriting, or a combination of both. It can transcribe diaries, letters, forms, logbooks and research notes. I have also used it to transcribe maps and diagrams. The potential uses for Digital History are numerous! </p>
                    <p>Transcription with Azure Cognitive Services is well documented, but does require some programming, hence this lesson.</p>

                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Knowledge of Python is not required, since all of the code is provided in the lesson. That said, basic Python knowledge would be useful for users who wish to understand the code or to tweak it for their purposes.</item>
                    <item>This lesson was written with <ref target="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</ref>, a web-based virtual Python programming platform. If you choose to use Google Colab to program Python (which I recommend), you will need a Google account. If you choose to run the code in this tutorial locally on your own machine, you will need to install <ref target="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.x</ref> and <ref target="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</ref>.</item>
                    <item>An internet connection.</item>
                    <item>A credit card or debit card. (Though there is a free tier of service for Microsoft, you are required to put a credit or debit card on file. The card is not charged if the number of files processed is below 5,000 each month.)</item>
                    <item>A telephone number. (This is to verify your identity.)</item>
                </list>
                <p>For further information on transcription, previous <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lessons which have demonstrated typed text recognition include: Andrew Akhlaghi's <ref target="/en/lessons/OCR-and-Machine-Translation">OCR and Machine Translation</ref>, Moritz Mähr's <ref target="/en/lessons/working-with-batches-of-pdf-files">Working with batches of PDF files</ref>, Laura Turner O'Hara's <ref target="/en/lessons/cleaning-ocrd-text-with-regular-expressions">Cleaning OCR’d text with Regular Expressions</ref> and Jon Crump's <ref target="/en/lessons/generating-an-ordered-data-set-from-an-OCR-text-file">Generating an Ordered Data Set from an OCR Text File</ref>. Recent advances in artificial intelligence now allow historians to automatically transcribe handwritten documents, within the limits of the writing systems used, the language and the legibility of the handwriting. Indeed, with the advent of computer algorithms referred to as <ref target="https://perma.cc/A522-65P6">deep learning</ref>, computers have achieved a level of generalized pattern recognition that allows them to recognize handwritten characters, even across various writers' handwriting styles. Another lesson to refer to is Isabelle Gribomont's <ref target="/en/lessons/ocr-with-google-vision-and-tesseract">OCR with Google Vision API and Tesseract</ref>: it provides a method to combine Google Cloud Platform’s character recognition with Tesseract’s layout detection. Tesseract’s layout detection capability could possibly be combined with Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services' handwriting recognition, to improve the structure of the transcribed text.</p>

                    <p>Azure Computer Vision uses a virtual computer resource to process the images you send it.  In this step, we will create that resource.</p>
                    <p>a) Go to <ref target="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com/</ref>.</p>
                    <p>b) Click <emph>+ Create a resource</emph>. You will need to do this twice. The first time is to set up your payment method as noted below.</p>

                    <p>d) Click <emph>Start with an Azure free trial</emph>. (If your account is not eligible for an Azure free trial, you will have to use pay-as-you-go pricing. You will still have a free level of consumption, if you have not spent it already.)</p>
                    <p>e) Input a telephone number to verify your identity.</p>
                    <p>f) Input your contact information and credit card number. Microsoft will verify the information. Once this is done, return to the <ref target="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</ref>.

                    <head>Step 3. Creating and storing a secret key and endpoint to access Computer Vision</head>
                    <p>To use the service, your computer program must send a password key to an endpoint URL at Microsoft Azure. The use of a URL to send and receive data is a standard method for using cloud-based services like Microsoft Azuew. Secret keys are a commonly used mechanism to protect cloud-based services from unauthorized users. As it says on Azure: "Do not share your keys. Store them securely...". Keeping your keys secure reduces the risk of someone else improperly using your credits to transcribe documents.</p>
                    <p>To reduce the risk of inadvertently sharing your secret key, store it in a separate file, in a different folder from the program you are writing. This protects your key better than including it inside code you may share.</p>
                    <p>a) In the Azure Portal, open the <hi rend="bold">Keys and Endpoint</hi> page of your resource.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <desc>Figure 3. Keys and Endpoint.</desc>
                        <graphic url="en-or-transcribing-handwritten-text-with-python-and-azure-03.png"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>b) Copy <code rend="inline">KEY 1</code> and paste it into a separate text file you can refer to. The key will look a bit like this <code rend="inline">b-f-9-7-0-8-4-8-b-7-a-6-6-8-1-9-</code>. There are two keys, but you only need to use one of them for this lesson.</p>
                    <p>c) Copy the endpoint URL and paste it in your file for reference. The endpoint contains your unique resource name and will be similar to this <code rend="inline">https://computer-vision-transcription-jhb.cognitiveservices.azure.com/</code>. This is the URL your Python program will use to communicate with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.</p>
                    <p>Regenerating your keys using the button on the <hi rend="bold">Keys and Endpoint</hi> page is a good way to keep keys secure. When your key changes, just copy and paste it to where you store your key. If you are using this service constantly, logic can be added to your program to use the second key while the first key is being regenerated, which helps avoid any errors.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Step 4. Creating a Python notebook</head>
                    <p>In this step, we will create a Python notebook in which we will write our program. We will use Google Colab, a cloud-based environment to program Python notebooks. However, these programs may instead be written in another Python environment of your choice.</p>
                    <p>a) Go to: <ref target="https://colab.research.google.com/">https://colab.research.google.com/</ref> (Google Colab is recommended for this lesson, but you can use another Python environment of your choice, such as Anaconda. See the lesson by Quinn Dombrowski, Tassie Gniady, and David Kloster, <ref target="/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks">Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks</ref>.)</p>
                    <p>b) Click <hi rend="bold">New Notebook</hi> in the dialog box that opens. Clicking <hi rend="bold">File</hi> &gt; <hi rend="bold">New Notebook</hi> in the menu will do the same thing.</p>
                    <p>c) When the notebook opens, give it a new title at the top: <code rend="inline">Transcribe handwriting and text with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.ipynb</code>.</p>
                    <p>d) The code below will store your key and endpoint in an environment variable which will make it accessible by the program. In Google Colab, you should be able to see an empty text box or "cell" in which to write code. If not, click the <emph>+ Code</emph> button to add a new code cell. Copy the code below into a cell in your notebook. Change <code rend="inline">https://computer-vision-transcription-jhb.cognitiveservices.azure.com/</code> to the endpoint URL you created in Step 3.</p>

                    <p>e) Run this cell by clicking the triangular "play" button. In the menu, <hi rend="bold">Runtime</hi> &gt; <hi rend="bold">Run the focused cell</hi> will do the same thing. Input your key in the prompt below the cell, then press <emph>Enter</emph>.</p>

                    <p>Running the cell will store the key and endpoint URL as environment variables in memory using Python's <code rend="inline">os</code> library, which will allow Python to use these values to communicate with Azure. The expected printed result is this:</p>

                    </ab>
                    <p>f) Click "x" in the notebook output to delete the text of your key. If you see an error message, check that you copied and input the key correctly.</p>

                    <p>When planning a handwriting transcription project, start with a sample to determine if the results are accurate enough for your purposes.

                    <p>This section will allow you to transcribe handwriting in an image stored in your Python environment. It's a lot like working with an image found online but, this time, you must have an image saved on the same computer you are running Python from. For Google Colab, we are using a virtual computer. For this example, you can download an image and save it. Here is an <ref target="/assets/transcribing-handwritten-text-with-python-and-azure/td_00044_b2.jpeg">example image to download</ref>.</p>
                    <p>a) Select or create a directory for your image. If you are working on Google Colab, you may use the working directory <code rend="inline">/content/</code>.</p>
                    <p>b) Download an example image and move it to your directory. In Google Colab, open the <hi rend="bold">Files</hi> pane by clicking the <hi rend="bold">Files</hi> icon on the left of the window. Click the <emph>Upload to session storage</emph> button to upload the file:</p>

                    <p>This section will allow you to transcribe handwriting of an image stored in your Python environment in the same way as in Project 2. You must have an image saved on the computer you are running Python from. If you do not, complete a) and b) of Project 2 to store an image in your Python environment.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this section is to reorganize the code used in Project 2 into a function.

                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>You have connected to Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision and transcribed the text from both an image found online and an image stored on your computer. In Projects 3 and 4, you added steps to process multiple images and store the transcribed text in a file. With Python, you can use a loop to transcribe all the images in a directory or on a series of web pages. You have also learned to use a function in Python to better organize your code. With what you have learned here, you are able to transcribe a collection of images of handwriting into digital text. Automated handwriting transcription makes possible further digital text analysis of documents such as letters, diaries, logbooks and reports, when manual transcription would be too time consuming.</p>
                <p>The coordinate positions of the transcribed text returned by Azure Cognitive Services allow you to further explore the use of handwriting transcription by transcribing written forms, lists or logs into structured data, like a spreadsheet or database. It is even possible to translate these coordinates into geographic coordinates, when the text is found on a map.</p>
                <p>As capabilities grow, so the potential uses of this type of transcription for Digital History will continue to grow as well. Additional documentation about Azure Cognitive Services is available on the <ref target="https://perma.cc/4MVY-P7QE">Microsoft Learn website</ref>.</p>
