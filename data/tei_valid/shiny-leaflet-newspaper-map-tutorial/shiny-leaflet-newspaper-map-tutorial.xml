                <p>This lesson demonstrates how to build a basic interactive web application using Shiny. Shiny is a library (a set of additional functions) for the programming language R. Its purpose is to facilitate the development of web applications, which allow a user to interact with R code using User Interface (UI) elements in a web browser, such as sliders, drop-down menus, and so forth. In the lesson, you will design and implement a simple application, consisting of a slider which allows a user to select a date range, which will then trigger some code in R, and display a set of corresponding points on an interactive map.</p>

                <p>In this lesson, you will learn:</p>

                    <item>The key layouts and design principles of the Shiny UI.</item>
                    <item>The concept and practice of 'reactive programming', as implemented by Shiny applications. Specifically, you'll learn how you can use Shiny to 'listen' for certain inputs, and how they are connected to outputs displayed in your app.</item>

                        <ref target="https://perma.cc/8SYH-TX26">Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)</ref> and interactive elements can help to make certain types of data-driven scholarly work more accessible or readable. To give a simple example, historians working with large-scale data might want to demonstrate the change in a variable over time. An interactive map with an adjustable timeline is, in some cases, easier to read and allows for more granularity than a series of static maps. Allowing a user to set the parameters of the visualisation can help to avoid some of the bias often found in data visualisations using time series (for example, arbitrarily drawing one map per decade).</p>
                    <p>Many research projects have interactive elements as outputs. Some examples include the <ref target="https://tudornetworks.net/">Tudor Networks of Power</ref> visualisation of the networks in the Tudor State Papers, the interactive <ref target="https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/press-tracer-visualise-newspaper-lineage/">Press Tracer</ref>, and (to give an example using Shiny), the <ref target="https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/GeoNewsMiner">GeoNewsMiner</ref>, which displays geocoded place-mentions in a corpus of newspapers. Interactive applications can also be useful tools for archivists: researchers at the National Archives UK have <ref target="https://perma.cc/C6U5-PYHF">created an app using Shiny</ref> which assesses the risk level in a digital collection through a series of questions answered by a user.</p>
                    <p>Another typical use-case for interactive applications is to provide an easier way to explore your own dataset, without ever intending for the application itself to be made publicly available. One might simply use interactive data visualizations to find interesting patterns or as a starting point for further research. In this way, interactivity can be particularly useful in helping explore and find patterns within large-scale datasets.</p>

                    <head>Options for creating a GUI</head>
                    <p>There are a number of ways one could approach the development of interactive visualisations similar to the examples above. One is to learn a specialist tool designed for manipulating web pages in response to data inputs, such as the <ref target="https://perma.cc/BG9S-KPJE">Javascript library D3</ref>. A second option would be to use existing web-based tools, either general ones such as <ref target="https://perma.cc/M6Y9-9ZCP">Tableau</ref> and <ref target="https://perma.cc/TAA2-W7WA">Rawgraphs</ref>, or ones with a more specific purpose such as <ref target="https://perma.cc/2W5A-PBJU">Palladio</ref> or <ref target="https://perma.cc/SS9Z-6DAG">Gephi</ref>. A third approach might be to use <ref target="https://perma.cc/CX23-VTAK">Jupyter notebooks</ref>, which allow you to share interactive code, and even, with some <ref target="https://perma.cc/ESA5-9MEJ">additional packages</ref>, to create a user interface.</p>
                    <p>This lesson covers a fourth approach: making interactive applications with a GUI using a library for a general-purpose programming language, such as <ref target="https://perma.cc/LXR5-BYC9">Bokeh</ref> or <ref target="https://perma.cc/J7T9-EHTJ">Dash</ref> for Python, or, as used in this tutorial, <ref target="https://perma.cc/CK9W-VRKN">Shiny</ref> for R. Both Python and R are open source, widely-used, versatile programming languages, with active communities and a huge range of third-party packages. There are many circumstances where it makes sense to use these as the basis for interactive applications. In essence, these packages act as interactive interfaces to the programming language, allowing for the creation of sliders, selectors, and so forth, which can then be used as inputs to dynamically change bits of code. In most cases, they require no technical expertise from the end-user. As they are designed to work in a browser, they work on any platform, and are easy to share.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Shiny and Reactive Programming</head>
                    <p>Shiny is based around a concept called <ref target="https://perma.cc/SGQ8-BU48">
                            <emph>reactivity</emph>
                        </ref>. Usually, when coding, we set a variable to a specific value, say <code rend="inline">x = 5</code>. In <emph>reactive programming</emph>, the variable is dependent on a changing input, usually set by a user (from a text slider or drop down list, for example). The code 'listens' for changes to these reactive variables and every time these special variables change, any output they are used to generate automatically updates.</p>
                    <p>However, this updating only happens within <hi rend="bold">reactive contexts</hi>. Shiny has three important reactive contexts: <code rend="inline">render*</code> functions, which are used to create R objects and display them in the app, <code rend="inline">observe({})</code>, and <code rend="inline">reactive({})</code>. In this tutorial you'll use reactivity to create a summarised dataframe of newspaper titles and their dates, which updates dynamically based on a user input of dates. Elsewhere in your app, you'll use a <code rend="inline">render*</code> function to display a map which will listen for changes to this reactive dataframe and update itself when any is found.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Shiny</head>
                    <p>The advantage to this approach is that creating Shiny applications is <emph>relatively</emph> simple if you already know R, and R's entire range of libraries and features can be harnessed by Shiny. In some circumstances, this might be preferable to learning a new language from scratch. If you have experience with R and just a little knowledge of Shiny, you can create very complex and useful applications, covering everything from maps to network analysis, from <ref target="https://perma.cc/YAX3-RZZP">machine learning models</ref> to full dashboards with lots of functionality. If you can program it with R, you can probably make it interactive with Shiny. The process of creating a Shiny UI is very flexible and easy to customise, meaning it is straightforward to make an application in a format that could be embedded into a project website using iframes: see the <ref target="https://www.mappingthegayguides.org/map/">
                            <emph>Mapping the Gay Guides</emph>
                        </ref> project for one example.</p>
                    <p>There are some drawbacks worth considering. For those who have no intention of using a language like R in other aspects of their work, learning it just to produce Shiny apps may be overkill. Shiny is open source and free to use, but by far the easiest way to publish your finished application to the web is using a service called shinyapps.io. Shinyapps.io is a commercial product with a free tier giving a limited number of hours of use (25), and after that you'll need to pay a monthly fee. You <emph>can</emph> run Shiny on your own server (or through something like <ref target="https://perma.cc/DEA2-HCC7">Amazon Web Services</ref>), but it's quite an involved process and requires some pretty advanced knowledge of configuring web servers. You should bear this in mind if you are thinking about using Shiny for a public-facing output, particularly if you think it might have lots of traffic and heavy use. As an alternative, some of the functionality of Shiny can be replicated in a simple HTML page using the R package <ref target="https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/index.html">crosstalk.</ref>

                <head>Historical Background and Data</head>
                <p>The national library of the United Kingdom, the <ref target="https://perma.cc/C7VP-VBTS">British Library</ref>, holds by far the largest collection of British and Irish newspapers in the world. The earliest serial news publication in its collection is from 1621, and it continues to collect to this day. The Library's catalogue holds a wealth of information on its newspaper holdings, which has been made publically available in the form of structured metadata. This metadata is essentially a list of newspaper titles, containing the publication dates and places, title changes and merges, and information on microfilm surrogates and digital holdings.   </p>
                <p>This structured metadata is the resource which you will use in this lesson. Tracing the metadata of this collection is a way for historians to chart the growth and change in the press over time and through different regions. Furthermore, it may help us to understand more about the Library's collection itself, including its gaps, biases, digitisation strategies and blind spots. The data might even indicate something about the changing demographics and industrialisation of Britain, as well as developments in communication technologies (trains and then telegraphs made it possible to have regional and local presses, for instance).  </p>
                <p>The newspaper industry (and therefore the collection) grew from a tiny number of titles published in London in the early seventeenth century to a flourishing weekly and daily provincial press in the eighteenth, and then a very large local press in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For much of the eighteenth century, a tax was added to every copy of a newspaper making them expensive and only available to the elite. In the following century this was repealed, and the press began —albeit slowly— to reflect the aspirations and diversity of the country and its various regions more fully. The application you'll create in this tutorial —an interactive map of published titles, controlled by a user-selected time slider— is a useful way to visualise these changes.</p>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Getting Hold of the Data</head>
                    <p>For this tutorial you will need to download two files: first, a title-level list of British and Irish newspapers (which will be referred to as the 'title list') and second, a helper dataset of place names and coordinates (which we'll refer to as the 'coordinates list') for matching the places found in the title list to locations on a map.</p>
                    <p>1. To get the title list, visit the <ref target="https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/datasets/7da47fac-a759-49e2-a95a-26d49004eba8?locale=en">British Library repository</ref>. The list is available on the repository in two formats: either a .zip file containing a .csv and a readme, or as an Excel spreadsheet. For this lesson, we'll work with the .csv format. Download the .zip file, and unzip it. Alternatively, you can download a copy of the dataset used in this tutorial on Github. To download this file, just view the <ref target="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial-data/BritishAndIrishNewspapersTitleList_20191118.csv">raw</ref> version and save the page locally.</p>
                    <p>2. The coordinates list is also available on Github. To download this file of coordinates, just view the <ref target="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/gh-pages/assets/shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial-data/newspaper_coordinates.csv">raw</ref> version and likewise save the page locally.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Understanding the Title List</head>
                    <p>Once this is done, take a look at the title list dataset (you can open it in R, a spreadsheet program or a text editor). The title list has been produced by the British Library and is published on their institutional repository. It contains metadata taken from the Library's catalogue of every newspaper published in Britain and Ireland up until the year 2019, a total of about 24,000 titles. There is more information available in a published data paper.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_1"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The .csv file (<code rend="inline">BritishAndIrishNewspapersTitleList_20191118.csv</code>) contains a number of fields for each title, including the name of the publication, subsequent and previous title names, several fields for geographic coverage, the first and last dates held, and some other information.</p>
                    <p>It's worth reading the <code rend="inline">README</code> file which comes along with the .zip file. This explains that there are several fields provided for geographic coverage, because the records have been catalogued over a long period of time, during which cataloguing standards and conventions have changed. The purpose here is to map the newspapers at a geographic point level, i.e., at the level of village, town, or city, rather than county or country. There are two fields where we might find the relevant geographic points to map: <code rend="inline">place_of_publication</code> and <code rend="inline">coverage_city</code>. These seem like different things (a newspaper could be published in one place but have geographic coverage over another, perhaps if the former didn't have a suitable newspaper press), but that's not how they've been used by cataloguers in practice. The <code rend="inline">README</code> file says that the latter (<code rend="inline">coverage_city</code>) contains more complete data, so that is the one you'll use to map the titles.</p>
                    <p>The other two fields of interest are the first and last dates held. The readme also tells us that the library does not have complete coverage, though it has most titles from the 1840s onwards, and effectively all titles from 1869 when Legal Deposit<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_2"/> was introduced. This means that the collection does not necessarily have all issues of a newspaper <emph>between</emph> the first and last dates held by the Library.</p>
                    <p>In this tutorial, you'll create an interactive slider which will allow a user to choose a start and an end date. This could be used to filter the data in one of two ways: either to show every newspaper published <emph>at some point</emph> between those two dates, or to map every newspaper <emph>first</emph> published between two given dates. Because the former scenario it would over-represent the Library's collections, to keep things simple, in this tutorial you'll work on the latter visualization of every newspaper published within a certain time frame.</p>

            <div type="2">
                <head>Setting up your Coding Environment and Creating the Shiny Application</head>
                <p>To demonstrate how Shiny works, in this tutorial you will take this dataset of newspaper titles, places of publication, and dates, and turn it into a basic interactive application. In total there are five short coding tasks your application will need to carry out:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Load the two necessary datasets</item>
                    <item>Create a user interface</item>
                    <item>Create a 'reactive' dataset of places, a count of their appearances, and their geographic coordinates</item>
                    <item>Turn this 'reactive' dataset into a special geographic dataset, called a simple features object</item>
                    <item>Create an interactive map using the R library, <ref target="https://perma.cc/RW6M-ZCG2">Leaflet</ref>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>First, however, you need to set up the correct programming environment and create a new Shiny application.  </p>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Install R and Rstudio</head>
                    <p>To get started with this tutorial, you should install the latest versions of <ref target="https://cran.rstudio.com/">R</ref> and <ref target="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">Rstudio</ref> on your local machine. The R programming language has a very popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called RStudio, which is often used alongside R, as it provides a large set of features to make coding in the language more convenient. We'll use RStudio throughout the lesson.</p>
                    <p>Previous <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lessons have covered <ref target="/en/lessons/r-basics-with-tabular-data">working with R</ref> and <ref target="/en/lessons/data_wrangling_and_management_in_R">working with the tidyverse</ref>. It would be useful to go through these lessons beforehand, to learn the basics of installing R and using the tidyverse for data wrangling.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Create a new RStudio Project</head>
                    <p>Once you have a working copy of R and Rstudio, open RStudio and create a new project to develop your application. Open the 'Create a Project' dialogue window using the menus (File-&gt;New Project). Select 'New Directory', then 'New Project'. Name your project directory and press 'Create Project'.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Before you continue, install the four packages necessary to complete the tutorial, if you don't have them already. Three of these can be installed directly through R Studio; the fourth might require extra steps. In the R console or in a separate R script, run the following commands:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_0" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_0.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Depending on your system setup, the fourth package, <code rend="inline">sf</code>, may require additional steps before it can be installed. Windows users should be able to install directly using <code rend="inline">install.packages('sf')</code>, but Mac users may need to install a third-party library, <code rend="inline">gdal</code>, before the installation will work, using <ref target="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</ref>. Install gdal by opening a Terminal window and entering the following commands:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_1" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_1.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>The latest instructions and further details can be found on the <ref target="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf">package Github page</ref>, including instructions for various Linux distros. Check the instructions under the <hi rend="bold">Installing</hi> header in the linked Github Readme file.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Create an Empty Shiny Application</head>
                    <p>A Shiny application consists of a script file with a special, reserved filename, <code rend="inline">app.R</code>, which tells R Studio to treat that script as an application and open it in a web browser when it is run. In this first section, you will create an application which will load the relevant libraries and datasets, and display a test 'Hello World' message. To do this, carry out the following steps:  </p>
                    <p>1. Set up an Application Folder</p>
                    <p>It's good practice to put all the necessary files for the application in their own folder, within the RStudio project. Do this by creating a new folder called 'newspaper-app' within the folder of the RStudio project you just created. Place the files you downloaded above (<code rend="inline">BritishAndIrishNewspapersTitleList_20191118.csv</code> and <code rend="inline">newspaper_coordinates.csv</code>) into this new folder.</p>
                    <p>2. Make the app.R file.</p>
                    <p>With RStudio open, click File-&gt; New file -&gt; R Script. Use the menu or <code rend="inline">command/ctrl + s</code> to save the file. Navigate to the new folder you've just created, and save the file there, entering <code rend="inline">app.R</code> as the file name. You should now have the following files in the 'newspaper-app' folder you just created:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <desc>Figure 1. Screenshot of application folder showing the files needed.</desc>
                        <graphic url="shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial-1.png"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>3. Load the relevant libraries</p>
                    <p style="alert alert-warning">
It's important to note that, unlike many tutorials, the code you're about to enter will not work if run line-by-line, but only when the enire `app.R` script itself is run from within RStudio.
</p>
                    <p>The first thing the app will need to do is prepare and load the data. This is done within the <code rend="inline">app.R</code> script, but outside the UI and server elements you'll create in a moment. First, load all the libraries you need to use by entering the following into your console:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_2" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_2.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>4. Load the datasets  </p>
                    <p>Next, the app should load the title list and coordinates list files as dataframes called <code rend="inline">title_list</code> and <code rend="inline">coordinates_list</code> respectively. Add the following line to your <code rend="inline">app.R</code> script, which should be displayed in the top-left panel of RStudio. Note that because the working directory is different from your app directory, these commands will only work when you run the app itself.</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_3" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_3.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Add the necessary Shiny Elements</head>
                    <p>To turn this into a Shiny application, this <code rend="inline">app.R</code> script needs three elements:</p>
                    <p>1.   The <hi rend="bold">UI</hi>, where the visual appearance of the app will be stored.</p>
                    <p>2.   The <hi rend="bold">server</hi>, which will contain the code used.</p>
                    <p>3.  The command to run the application itself.</p>
                    <p>Next you'll create each of these in turn.</p>
                    <p>1. Create an Empty UI Element</p>
                    <p>The UI is an element which will contain a number of special Shiny commands to define how the application will look. We'll examine the specific options below, but generally, you begin by specifying a page type, within which the various components of the UI are nested; then, a layout type, within that the specific layout elements; and finally within these, the various components of the app itself.</p>
                    <p>The type you'll use is called <code rend="inline">fluidPage()</code>, a page —which dynamically resizes depending on the size of the browser window— containing a fluid layout of rows which in turn contain columns.</p>
                    <p>The first step is to create all the basic elements needed for an app, before filling them with the required components. To start with, make a blank UI element by setting the variable <code rend="inline">ui</code> to the element <code rend="inline">fluidPage()</code>. So you know your application is running when you first test it, add a simple 'Hello World' message to the UI element. Add the following code in your <code rend="inline">app.R</code> script:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_4" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_4.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>2. Create the Server Element</p>
                    <p>Next up is the server part. The server is created as an R function with two arguments, <code rend="inline">input</code> and <code rend="inline">output</code> (you don't need to worry about what the input and output arguments do for now, as long as they are there).<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_3"/> In R a function is made using the command <code rend="inline">function(){}</code>, specifying the arguments in parentheses, and then the function code between curly braces. All the code for the logic of the application will live between these two curly braces.</p>
                    <p>Specify the server part using the following code:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_5" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_5.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>3. Add the command to run the application.</p>
                    <p>Finally, add the command to run the application itself. This is another special Shiny command, <code rend="inline">shinyApp()</code>, with the UI and server items you've just made as arguments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <code rend="inline">shinyApp(ui, server)</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>The full <code rend="inline">app.R</code> file should now contain the following lines:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_6" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_6.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>

                <div type="3">
                    <head>Test Your New Application</head>
                    <p>Once you have created these items, resave the <code rend="inline">app.R</code> file. RStudio will now recognise it as a Shiny application, and the icons at the top of the panel will change, giving a 'Run App' option (Figure 2). If you click <code rend="inline">Run App</code>, it will run the application in a new window using RStudio's in-built browser.  </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>You should see a mostly-blank web page with 'Hello World' displayed in the top-left corner. You'll also notice that while the app is running you can't run any code in RStudio: the console shows up as 'busy'. To stop the application, simply close the in-built browser. You can also use the 'open in browser' option to try out the app in your default web browser.  </p>

                    <head>Designing the User Interface</head>
                    <p>The Shiny UI utilises the <ref target="https://perma.cc/BK3T-V6HP">Bootstrap</ref> format. The UI is built around a grid system of rows and columns, allowing for customisable layouts. See the <ref target="https://perma.cc/9U3B-AHF6">official documentation</ref> for more information on the various options and how to create these layouts. For this application, we'll use a layout known as the <code rend="inline">sidebarLayout</code>, which consists of a title, a sidebar column on the left of the page for user inputs, and a main panel to display the results. The following wireframe diagram should help you to visualise the layout:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <desc>Figure 3. Wireframe diagram displaying the structure of the sidebar layout.</desc>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The next step is to fill the <code rend="inline">ui</code> element with the components necessary to render this sidebar layout. First, use the <code rend="inline">titlePanel</code> element to give your application a title, and add the sidebar element. Within the <code rend="inline">fluidPage()</code> object, delete the 'Hello World' message and replace with the following:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_7" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_7.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Following this, populate the layout with specific parts of the webpage, components called <code rend="inline">sidebarPanel()</code> and <code rend="inline">mainPanel()</code>. Do this by placing them within <code rend="inline">sidebarLayout()</code>.</p>
                    <p>The full UI element should now look like this:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_8" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_8.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>You'll notice that these nested commands correspond to the layout of the wireframe diagram in Figure 3 above.  </p>

                    <head>Add a 'Widget': the sliderInput Control</head>
                    <p>In Shiny, users update values using various interactive, customisable controls known as 'widgets'. The full list can be found in the <ref target="https://perma.cc/GW78-FQEJ">Shiny widget gallery</ref>. The widget you're going to use is called <code rend="inline">sliderInput()</code>. This will display an interactive sliding bar with a large number of options, such as the minimum, maximum and starting value(s). You can also set the step and format of the numbers (type <code rend="inline">?sliderInput</code> in the console to get a full list of options and explanations). Here you'll make one with a minimum year of 1620 (the earliest data point in the title list), and a maximum of 2019 (the most recent).</p>
                    <p>The starting (default) value can be a single number, or a vector of two numbers. If the latter is used, the slider will be double-sided, with a first and second value. This is what we want to use, so that a user can specify a range of years.</p>
                    <p>The following code will create a slider with two draggable ends, set by default to 1700 and 1750:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_9" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_9.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Insert this code between the parentheses of the <code rend="inline">sidebarPanel = sidebarPanel( )</code> command in your script. If you get lost or need to debug, take a look at <ref target="#Final-code">the finished code</ref> provided at the end of this lesson.</p>
                    <p>At this point, run the application to see how the slider looks. You should see a grey panel on the left (the sidebar panel), containing the slider widget. If you hover over the slider, you'll notice that you can drag each end (to select a range size) and you can also drag the middle (which will move the entire slider over a window of the selected range size).</p>

                    <head>Put the leafletOutput in the mainPanel Element</head>
                    <p>In Shiny, you need to let the UI know it should display an output (some kind of R element, such as a table of data or a plot, or something as simple as a line of text) created in the server code. This is done by creating an element in the UI from the <code rend="inline">*Output</code> family of commands. Each R element you can display in Shiny has its own <code rend="inline">*Output</code> command: here, you'll use <code rend="inline">leafletOutput()</code>, which tells the UI to create a Leaflet map. <code rend="inline">leafletOutput</code> has one required argument: its output ID. This label will be used to match the UI element to the actual map object you'll create in the server code later. Set this label as 'map'. Insert the following code <emph>between the parentheses of <code rend="inline">mainPanel()</code>
                        </emph>:</p>

                <head>Creating the Server Logic</head>
                <p>Next you need to write the logic to create an object which will be displayed in the UI. This has two parts. First, you'll create a <emph>reactive element</emph>, which, as explained above, is a special object which will listen for changes to the user input, and remake itself as necessary. Second, you'll create an <emph>output</emph> which will contain the interactive map itself.</p>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Create the reactive for the Leaflet map</head>
                    <p>First, create the reactive element. In this case, it will be a special type of geographic dataset called a <emph>simple features object</emph>. This format has been covered in a previous <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson, <ref target="/en/lessons/geospatial-data-analysis">'Using Geospatial Data to Inform Historical Research in R'</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Whenever the user changes the variables in the date slider in any way, your app will run through a set of commands:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>
                            <p>Filter the title list to the set of dates selected by the user</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Make a count of the number of times each place occurs in this filtered list</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Match the places to a set of coordinates using a join</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Convert the result into a simple features object</p>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>To create a reactive object called <code rend="inline">map_df</code>, add the following code <emph>within the curly braces of the server component</emph>:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_11" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_11.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>This code performs the following functions:</p>
                    <p>1. Filter the newspapers dataset using the command <code rend="inline">filter()</code>, using the values from the <code rend="inline">sliderInput</code> widget. These values are accessed using <code rend="inline">input$&lt;LABELNAME&gt;</code>, which in this case is <code rend="inline">input$years</code>, though there is a further complication to note. Remember you set the value of the <code rend="inline">sliderInput</code> to a vector of length two, so that a range could be selected? The two numbers of this range are stored in <code rend="inline">input$years[1]</code> and <code rend="inline">input$years[2]</code>. These are the values which you need to access in order to filter the data. The <code rend="inline">filter</code> function returns rows of a dataframe where a specified set of conditions are true: in this case, where the column <code rend="inline">first_date_held</code> is greater than the first value, and lesser than the second.</p>
                    <p>2. <code rend="inline">count()</code> on this filtered dataset to produce a dataframe of each city and a tally of the times they occur. Specify the name of the new column containing the tallies with the argument <code rend="inline">name =</code>.</p>
                    <p>3. Perform a join (a type of merge which matches two dataframes together based on a common key) to merge the coordinates dataframe to the counts dataframe using <code rend="inline">left_join()</code>. You should specify the key on which to join, which is <code rend="inline">coverage_city</code>.</p>
                    <p>4. There are a small number of newspaper titles without lat/long coordinates, which would cause an error when creating the geographic object. Filter these out with <code rend="inline">filter(!is.na(lat) &amp; !is.na(lng))</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Finally, turn it into a simple features object, using <code rend="inline">st_as_sf()</code>. To do this, specify the lat/long coordinates columns it should use using <code rend="inline">coords</code>, and then use <code rend="inline">st_set_crs</code> to set a coordinate reference system.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#note_4"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>This simple features dataframe can be accessed in any reactive context by Shiny using <code rend="inline">map_df()</code> and can be used by multiple outputs at once: for example you could build an app which displays both a map and a bar chart, each using the same reactive object.</p>

                <div type="3">
                    <head>Create the Leaflet Map</head>
                    <p>The last thing to do is to create the map itself. This is done using the library <code rend="inline">leaflet</code>, which allows for interactive, zoomable maps. It works particularly well with Shiny. Add the following code within the <code rend="inline">server()</code> element, just underneath the <code rend="inline">map_df</code> reactive element:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_12" corresp="code_shiny-leaflet-newspaper-map-tutorial_12.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>There are some quite complex things going on here so it is important to go through the code in detail. In Shiny, you create reactivity by connecting <hi rend="bold">inputs</hi> to <hi rend="bold">outputs</hi>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">Inputs</hi>, in this context, are the variables adjusted by the user. Remember the <code rend="inline">sliderInput()</code> you created in the UI above, with the label 'years'? We've already seen that the value for it is stored by Shiny in the variable <code rend="inline">input$years</code>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">Outputs</hi> are the R expressions which tell Shiny what to display in the UI and are created, in the server, with the variable name <code rend="inline">output$*</code>. Outputs need to be matched to a UI <code rend="inline">*Output</code> element. In the UI, you created a <code rend="inline">leaflet</code> output with the label <code rend="inline">map</code> using the code <code rend="inline">leafletOutput('map')</code>. This should be matched to an output in the server named <code rend="inline">output$map</code>.</p>
                    <p>In turn, this <code rend="inline">output$map</code> variable should be set to a Shiny <code rend="inline">render*</code> function, which tells Shiny what kind of object is to be rendered in the UI. The one we need is called <code rend="inline">renderLeaflet</code>, which tells the UI to output a map created by the <code rend="inline">leaflet</code> library. The <code rend="inline">renderLeaflet</code> object has both parentheses and curly braces, just like the reactive object we created above.</p>
                    <p>The Leaflet map itself will be created within this. First, add the function <code rend="inline">leaflet()</code>. Next, add the default tiles (the zoomable map images) using <code rend="inline">addTiles()</code>. Next, set the default map position and zoom to Britain and Ireland using the command <code rend="inline">setView(lng = -5, lat = 54, zoom = 5)</code>.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="3">
                    <head>Draw Points using the Reactive Dataframe</head>
                    <p>Pause here and run the application again. All being well, you should see an interactive map of Britain and Ireland to the right of the slider. You can zoom and scroll it, though not much else. It needs to be populated with points representing the count of titles from each place.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>To do this, use the command <code rend="inline">addCircleMarkers()</code>, which adds a graphical layer of circles to the <code rend="inline">leaflet</code> map, with coordinates taken from a geographic data object. Using the <code rend="inline">%&gt;%</code> pipe, add the following after the <code rend="inline">addCircleMarkers()</code> function (see the <ref target="#Final-code">final code</ref> if you're not sure where this should go):</p>
                    <ab>

                    </ab>
                    <p>Here is the crucial bit: instead of a fixed data source, the above specifies that <code rend="inline">addCircleMarkers</code> should use the reactive dataframe we created earlier, with the argument <code rend="inline">data = map_df()</code>. Notice that unlike regular variables in R, this has a pair of parentheses after it, denoting that it is a special reactive variable. Each time the application notices a change to this reactive object, it will redraw the map with the new data.</p>
                    <p>At this point you can also set the radius of the circles to correspond to the column containing the count of titles for each place, using <code rend="inline">radius = ~sqrt(titles)</code>. We use the square root, because that makes the area of the circles correctly proportional to the count.</p>

                    <p>It's time to run the application again. Now, there should be variously-sized circles dotted across the map. Try moving or dragging the sliders - the map should update with every change. Congratulations, you've made your first Shiny app!</p>

                <head>Improving the Application</head>
                <p>To learn more about Shiny and Leaflet, you could try adding some of the following features to your application:</p>
                <p>First, add an additional user input to filter the map data. Using another widget, <code rend="inline">selectInput</code>, you could allow a user to display data from just one of the four countries in the title list. Type <code rend="inline">?selectInput</code> into the console to get help on the parameters you need to do this correctly. Additional inputs can be placed under the existing <code rend="inline">sliderInput</code>, separated by a comma.</p>
                <p>Next, add some elements to the Leaflet map. A full list of options can be found using <code rend="inline">?circleMarkers</code> in RStudio. For example, you can add a label to the points with <code rend="inline">label = coverage_city</code>.</p>
                <p>You'll notice that every time you move the slider, the entire map redraws and resets its view, which isn't very elegant. This can be fixed using another function called <code rend="inline">leafletProxy</code>. In essence, create an empty Leaflet map (without the <code rend="inline">circleMarkers</code>) as above. Then in another reactive context, <code rend="inline">observe</code>, you'll add the code to redraw the changing parts of the map, using <code rend="inline">leafletProxy</code>. The instructions for how to do this can be found on <ref target="https://perma.cc/CZ84-CW9F">Leaflet's docs</ref>.  </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Interactive visualisations can help to bring new insights to historical data. In this tutorial we made use of some powerful R packages, such as the <code rend="inline">tidyverse</code> and <code rend="inline">leaflet,</code> and were able to use these in an interactive environment, rather than having to prepare all the data in advance. We learned how and why we might use reactive programming, which allows us to create dynamic R code where user inputs take the place of fixed variables.</p>
                <p>This approach can be easily adapted to suit a range of different data formats and modes of analysis. The relatively low barrier to entry makes it easy to create quick applications which can make working with large-scale data less painful. Shiny applications are also a useful way to share some of the benefits of the programming capabilities of R with a non-technical audience or project team members. It's relatively easy to create an application that will allow a user to visualize their own data analysis with R, without having to actually code or use the command line.</p>
