You're actually super excited by the possibility of working with users--it's one of your favorite parts of what you do. You're confident in your technical abilities, but are hoping to land a job as a liaison between devs and clients after school. While you're initially happy you were honest, you see a frown cross Ann's face and think you see Steve smirk. You're aware of the stereotype that female devs are better at "soft skills" than programming and worry that you just confirmed Steve's bias and made Ann's life more difficult. 

After the meeting, Steve shows you to [[your desk]].
