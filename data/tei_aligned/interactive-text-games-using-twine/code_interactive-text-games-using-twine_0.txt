It's your first day at your summer internship as a web developer. You're excited, but also a little nervous. As you enter the office, you quickly find your manager Steve. He lets you know that the company recently instituted a mentorship program geared toward women. Steve introduces you to your mentor Ann, who manages a different team. You're excited the company has instituted this initiative, but a little disappointed that your check-ins with Ann will occur during your lunch break.   

Steve and Ann lead you into a meeting room to discuss what you are interested in working on.
