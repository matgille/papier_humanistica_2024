Technology has expanded research and visualization possibilities , thereby changing the ways we can think about and interpret the past .þAs a result , Map Warper is both product and producer of these technological relationships that generate and expand new interpretations . Georeferencing is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to a scanned map or raster image .
As a result , Map Warper is both product and producer of these technological relationships that generate and expand new interpretations .þMany historians georeference maps to study how places have changed over time .
Georeferencing is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to a scanned map or raster image .þIn this lesson , we will take you through the steps to align geographic coordinates to a scanned historical map and show you how to export your georeferenced map . This lesson was conceived as the first component of a larger module oriented toward the usage of digital tools for georeferencing , vectorization , extraction , organization , and experimentation with geographic data in archival bibliography and cartography digitized by different institutes ( archives , libraries , museums ) .
Many historians georeference maps to study how places have changed over time .þIn this tutorial you will georeference an 1860 map of North Carolina and South Carolina from the David Rumsey Map Collection . There is an export button above the map .
þClick the export button to download the image of the map .
þThe file will download as a .zip file , which includes a .jpg file of the map and a metadata .txt file .
þWhen clicking on the export button , we recommend downloading one of the largest files to ensure you have the highest resolution of the map .
þOnce you have uncompressed the .zip file , save the .jpg to your computer as NC_SC.jpg .
In this lesson , we will take you through the steps to align geographic coordinates to a scanned historical map and show you how to export your georeferenced map .þBefore you begin georeferencing a scanned map , it is important to understand the locations depicted on the map , as well as the historic context of the map ’ s creation . Not all historic maps are good candidates for georeferencing .
þThe map must include enough information to allow the user to confidently assign latitude and longitude coordinates or align it with a Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) map using physical features .
þOften , you will need to research the location of historic places and features that no longer exist , and make an informed decision to identify their proper placement .
þSome maps may not have enough geographic information , and may become so warped when georeferenced that they become illegible or inaccurate .

This lesson was conceived as the first component of a larger module oriented toward the usage of digital tools for georeferencing , vectorization , extraction , organization , and experimentation with geographic data in archival bibliography and cartography digitized by different institutes ( archives , libraries , museums ) .þA historical map warped into an irregular quadrilateral shape , and overlaid onto a larger-scale contemporary map The scale , resolution , and projection of a scanned map are also important considerations when choosing a historic map to georeference .
þSmall scale maps are generally not well-suited for highly detailed georeferencing and may cause problems with representing exact feature locations .
þWhen selecting or scanning a historic map for georeferencing , it is best to use a map that has been scanned at a high resolution ( 300 dpi or greater ) , so that you can easily see the features on the map when zooming in and out .
þIt is also best practice to use the same projection as the historic map in order to minimize distortion .
In this tutorial you will georeference an 1860 map of North Carolina and South Carolina from the David Rumsey Map Collection .þGeoreferencing a map in the wrong projection can create a mismatch between the historical and current maps , stretching the lines , shapes , and the distance between objects . Map Warper does not provide an option to re-project your map data ; if you are unable to achieve a legible map , or if you are measuring distance , you may need to use a more advanced GIS software , such as QGIS which will allow you to specify the map projections .
þFor more details on best practices for georeferencing , see Esri ’ s list of recommendations .

þTake a moment to move the map on the right to the North Carolina and South Carolina region .
þThe arrows at the top of the screen move the map slightly to the north , south , east , and west , and are useful when you need to make small adjustments to the map .
þYou can zoom in and out with the slider or with your trackpad/mouse .
þTo move around a map , click the hand icon .
þ3 .
þOnce you feel comfortable moving around the maps , select your first control point .
þStart from the historic map and choose a location —for example , a city— that will be relatively easy to find .
þ4 .
þThen , click the green control point marker on the modern map and find the same location to match them up .
þ5 .
þIf you do not click the Add Control Point button , the next time you click on a map , the control point you 've added will move .
þThis functionality gives you the flexibility to adjust your points while adding them , but can be confusing if you don ’ t realize that your point has moved because you didn ’ t click Add Control Point .
þ6 .
þAdd at least 4 or 5 points .
þSpreading the points out across your historic map and focusing on state borders , rivers , county lines , and major cities is a good strategy .
þIf you need to delete a control point , click on `` Control Points '' in the Control Panel below the map .
þ7 .
þSelecting Control Points will display all of the points you have added , and allow you to delete any points that you want to re-do .
þYou can also change latitude and longitude points manually .
þNote : You will see there is an Error value for each control point .
þMap Warper uses a Root Mean Square ( RMS ) error calculation to evaluate the transformation of the different control points .
þThe RMS error provides a rough guide to how consistent your control points are to one another with reference to the map ’ s transformation , and it assesses how distorted your map will be .
You can also add the following georeferenced basemaps from Map Warper :þHigh RMS error values indicate that your control points are less consistent with one another , while a low RMS error value indicates more consistency and reduced distortion . It is generally recommended that you keep your error values low and replace or remove control points with high values .
þWhile the RMS error provides a good way to assess the transformation ’ s accuracy , you should always re-evaluate how well your scanned map matches up to the GIS modern map .
þFor more information about RMS errors , please see Esri ’ s section on interpreting the root mean square error in their Overview of georeferencing .
