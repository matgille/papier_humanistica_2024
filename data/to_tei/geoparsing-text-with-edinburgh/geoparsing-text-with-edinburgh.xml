                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This is a lesson on how to use the <ref target="https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/geoparser/">Edinburgh Geoparser</ref>.  The Geoparser allows you to process a piece of English-language text and extract and resolve the locations contained within it. Among other uses, geo-resolution of locations makes it possible to map the data.</p>
                <p>The Geoparser works best on running text, as it considers locations in context for disambiguation. For example, if you would like to get a sense of the place names mentioned in a piece of text, the Geoparser can be used to identify terms in a document that are likely to refer to place names.  It will then provide its best guess as to where those places are in terms of latitute/longitude coordinates.</p>
                <p>In December 2015, the Edinburgh Geoparser was released under the University of Edinburgh’s GPL license to be used by other researchers in the field of text mining and natural language processing as well as scholars who are interested in geoparsing text. More information on its documentation, publications using it and how to download it can be found <ref target="https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/geoparser/">here</ref>.</p>
                <p>A simple online demo of the vanilla Edinburgh Geoparser can be tried out <ref target="http://jekyll.inf.ed.ac.uk/geoparser.html">here</ref>. It provides only the visual interface to the Geoparser output after uploading a text file and selecting a gazetteer.  The demo is otherwise not configurable and should only be used to try out small examples and not for geo-parsing a large number of files.</p>
                <p>The following lesson explains how the Edinburgh Geoparser works under the hood and contains information on:</p>

                <head>Prerequisites and Terminology</head>
                <p>This lesson requires users to be familiar with the command line.  If not then you should first follow the lesson <ref target="/en/lessons/intro-to-bash">Introduction to the Bash Command Line</ref>.</p>
                <p>The Geoparser works on MacOS or Linux but is not supported for Windows. The following lesson provides command line instructions for MacOSX users and equivalent commands for Linux users (only if different to the Mac versions).</p>
                <p>The terms geo-parsing and geo-referencing are used interchangeably in this lesson and refer to the entire process of identifying place names in text (place name recognition) and disambiguating them by assigning their most likely latitude/longitude pairs (geo-resolution).</p>
                <p>The Edinburgh Geoparser is used in conjunction with various gazetteers. The term <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer">gazetteer</ref> here refers to a list of place names and information about them (e.g. their latitude/longitude coordinates, population size and country they are contained in).  More information on <ref target="/en/lessons/extracting-keywords">Using Gazetteers to Extract Sets of Keywords from Free-Flowing Texts</ref> can be found in Adam Cryble's Programming Historian lesson. His lesson focusses on matching gazetteer entries in text to identify place names.  The Edinburgh Geoparser goes beyond string matching as it applies a large number of rules to identify place names and other types of named entities in text and goes on to ground the extracted entities (either by geo-resolution or date normalisation).</p>

                <head>Downloading and Setting up the Geoparser</head>
                <p>The current Edinburgh Geoparser download can be found at <ref target="https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/geoparser/">https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/geoparser/</ref>.</p>
                <p>Go to the Download section and click on The Edinburgh Geoparser link.  All you need to do then is accept the license, fill in some personal details, and then press <hi rend="bold">Download</hi>.  A compressed file called <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3.tar.gz</code> will be downloaded to your Download directory or to wherever you specified the download to go.  Note that this file name will change when new versions of the tool are released.</p>
                <p>Some machines will automatically decompress the .gz file and create the directory <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3</code>.  If this happens, and you see the <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3</code> directory appear, move this new directory to wherever you want it to be installed and go to step 2.  If this does not happen, and your machine does not decompress the <code rend="inline">.tar.gz</code> file and create a new directory automatically, follow step 1 first.  (Note that version 1.3 is the current release but this number will change in the future.)</p>
                <h4>Installation Steps via the GUI interface</h4>
                <p>1. Go to the download of the Geoparser and move it to the directory of your choice (e.g. into the <code rend="inline">Software</code> directory).  Then double-click on the <code rend="inline">.gz</code> or <code rend="inline">.tar</code> file (if is was already decompressed automatically).  A new directory called <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3</code> will appear (see Figure 1).</p>

                </figure>
                <p>If you double-click on the geoparser-1.3 folder you can see the content of the Geoparser (see Figure 2). That's it. You're ready to geo-parse.</p>

                    <head>Installation Steps for the Command Line</head>
                    <p>1. Move (<code rend="inline">mv</code>) the <code rend="inline">.tar.gz</code> file to the directory where you want to install the Geoparser.  In this case, I'd like the Geoparser to be installed in my <code rend="inline">Software</code> directory inside the <code rend="inline">Documents</code> directory.  If you don’t have a Software directory, create it first:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_0" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_0.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Then type:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_1" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_1.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>For this lesson it is assumed that the geoparser is now located inside the <code rend="inline">~/Documents/Software</code> directory.  You may however want to specify a different directory you’d like to install it in and adjust these commands by specifying the place where the Geoparser was downloaded and save at. For example if you'd like to create a new directory called <code rend="inline">geoparsing</code> in your home directory and put the Geoparser there, then you would type:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_2" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_2.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>2. Next, you need to change into the directory containing the <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3.tar.gz</code> file so that the following command is local to that directory and you do not have to specify the entire path leading to it.  To do that you use the command <code rend="inline">cd</code> (change directory), e.g.: </p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_3" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_3.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>3. Run the following command on the command line to decompress the download:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_4" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_4.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>You should see a long list of files appear on screen that are part of the distribution.  The <code rend="inline">Software</code> directory will now contain a new directory called <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3</code>.  It contains:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>

                    </ab>
                    <p>Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and set up the Geoparser, and you can now begin geo-parsing.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="2">
                <head>Setting up Mapping</head>
                <p>The visualisation component of the Geoparser uses Leaflet mapping software in conjunction with either Mapbox or OpenStreetMap map tiles.</p>
                <p>Out of the box the Geoparser uses OpenStreetMap tiles for mapping. You can run the Geoparser (see next Section) as is without setting the environment variable <code rend="inline">GEOPARSER_MAP_KEY</code>. If <code rend="inline">GEOPARSER_MAP_KEY</code> is not set, OpenStreetMap tiles will be used by default. The main disadvantage of this - from the point of view of an English-language geoparser - is that OpenStreetMap generally displays maps in the language of the area, rather than English.</p>
                <p>To use the Geoparser with Mapbox tiles you will need a Mapbox key (access token) which can be obtained from <ref target="http://www.mapbox.com">www.mapbox.com</ref>. When you create a Mapbox account you are automatically assigned a public access token. You can use that or create a new one.  Before running the Geoparser you should set the environment variable <code rend="inline">GEOPARSER_MAP_KEY</code> to your access token. To do that you have to type the following command into your terminal, replacing "TOKEN" with your Mapbox access token:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_6" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_6.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>You can also assign this variable in the same way in your <code rend="inline">.bashrc</code>, <code rend="inline">.profile</code> or <code rend="inline">.bash_profile</code> file depending on your operating system and setup, which will set this variable every time a terminal is started up.</p>
                <p>Note that Mapbox now also requires you to provide a credit card number when creating an account, and you may not want to do this in which case you still have the default OpenStreetMap mapping option. </p>

            <div type="2">
                <head>Geo-parsing a Text File</head>
                <p>In this section you will learn how to geo-parse a simple text file.  Use the <code rend="inline">cd</code> command to go the geoparser’s script directory:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_7" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_7.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>and try out one of the examples provided as part of the distribution by running the following two commands:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_8" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_8.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>| For those not so familiar with working on the command line, let's look at the syntax used here.  Firstly, it is useful to know that the pipe character (<code rend="inline">|</code>) is used to concatenate different commands. |</p>
                <p>In the previous example the first command is:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_9" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_9.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>| The command <code rend="inline">cat</code> prints a file (in this case the file is called <code rend="inline">172172.txt</code> and it is located in the <code rend="inline">in</code> directory of the geoparser) to your screen (or to <emph>standard out</emph> or short <emph>stdout</emph>).  The pipe character (<code rend="inline">|</code>) is used to send the standard output of one command to the next command which can then use it as <emph>standard in</emph> (or short <emph>stdin</emph>). |</p>
                <p>The second command is:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_10" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_10.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>It takes the stdout from the first command and runs the Geoparser with the following options (<code rend="inline">-t</code>, <code rend="inline">-g</code> and <code rend="inline">-o</code>):</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <code rend="inline">-t</code> specifies the format of your input.  Text input (<code rend="inline">plain</code>) is recommended for geo-parsing.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <code rend="inline">-g</code> specifies the gazetteer that should be queried.  In the above example, the gazetteer selected is <ref target="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</ref> (<code rend="inline">geonames</code>), a large global gazetteer.  You can also specify other gazetteers, for example the DEEP gazetteer of historical placenames in England (<code rend="inline">deep</code>) or the Pleiades+ gazetteer of ancient places (<code rend="inline">plplus</code>).  For more information on the types of gazetteers offered as part of the distribution see the Geoparser documentation <ref target="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/geoparser/documentation/v1.3/html/gaz.html">here</ref>.</p>
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <p>
                            <code rend="inline">-o</code> specifies two pieces of information, the output directory (<code rend="inline">../out</code>) which is located within the <code rend="inline">geoparser-1.3</code> directory and a prefix for the output file name (in this case <code rend="inline">172172</code>, the same prefix as that of the input file name). Once the command is run and the Geoparser is finished, the result files appear in the output directory (<code rend="inline">../out</code>) starting with the specified prefix.</p>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <p>When running the Geoparser, the specified text file is going through a series of processing steps which are combined into one pipeline.  It is first <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Tokenization_">tokenised</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">part-of-speech-tagged</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation">lemmatised</ref>. After these initial steps, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity recognition</ref> is performed to identify location and person names as well as dates.  It was  found that identifying location and person names in parallel helps to distinguish some ambiguous cases (like the string "Lewis" which could refer to a first name or the Scottish island) and where their context helps to distinguish between them.  The extracted locations are then resolved to latitude/longitude coordinate pairs.  The text is then further processed by identifying syntactic phrases (chunking) and temporal relations.  The latter two steps are not very relevant to this lesson and will therefore not be explained in detail.  Finally, visualisations are created to be able to inspect the file and the Geoparser output using a map interface in a browser.  For more information on each of the sub-components of the Geoparser, see the documentation <ref target="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/geoparser/documentation/v1.3/html/pipeline.html">here</ref>.</p>
                <p>Note that when using the Geoparser in combination with the GeoNames gazetteer some historical place names will not be identified as they are missing from the gazetteer.  Also the Geoparser team can provide additional pre-processing to improve the quality of optical-character recognised output (e.g. to fix soft-hyphen splitting or to deal with the long “s” character).  Those scripts are not distributed with the standard distribution but available on request.</p>
                <p>To see the output files, go to the <code rend="inline">out</code> directory:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_11" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_11.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Now you can see all the files that the Geoparser has produced from the original <code rend="inline">172172.txt</code> file.

                <p>You can also specify the option <code rend="inline">-top</code> on the command line. This creates output files which only contain the top-ranked location candidates, so only the green geo-coordinate pairs and pins are displayed (see Figure 4).</p>

                <p>The vanilla download works most accurately with running English text.  It even works on individual sentences.  Geo-resolution accuracy increases however if the Geoparser has access to more context, including other place names.  On the other hand, the Geoparser is not well suited to process large documents made up of several sub-texts, e.g. a journal issue made up of articles. In the latter case it would be better to split the document into the articles first and geo-parse each article individually.</p>

                    <p>If you know that your text is about a particular geographical area you can instruct the Geoparser to give this area higher weighting during the geo-resolution step. For example, if you know that your data is mostly set in Canada then it may make sense to give candidate locations inside Canada higher preference.  By doing so the Geoparser will prefer places within the specified area but it will still consider locations outside it if other factors give them higher weighting.</p>

                    <p>You can grab the coordinates of a bounding box for a particular area using this online <ref target="http://boundingbox.klokantech.com">BoundingBox</ref> tool. For example, a bounding box for Canada is <code rend="inline">[W:-141.002701, N:83.110619, E:-52.620201, S:41.681019]</code> (see Figure 5)</p>

                    </ab>
                    <p>Here, the <code rend="inline">score</code> has been set to 2.  This gives a location within the bounding box twice as much weight as for example the population size of a location during geo-resolution.</p>

                    <p>In this case, all place names (including Washington, Wimbledon, Germany and France) were resolved to locations within the bounding box (see Figure 6).  The locality option should therefore be used with care and should ideally only be applied to documents where you are relatively certain that all or most locations appear within the specified area.</p>

                    <head>Specifying a Document Date</head>
                    <p>As well as identifying locations and person names within text, the Geoparser also recognises temporal expressions (dates and times) in textual data and normalises them. Normalisation here means that the temporal expressions are enriched with additional information of when exactly they occurred. For example, it computes which the exact calendar date the expression "last Friday" refers to.</p>
                    <p>In order to do this well, it is preferable to provide the Geoparser with the date of the document (if known). To try this out using the previous example, type the following command:</p>

                    <p>The document date specified on the command line is stored in the XML output and all relative temporal expression will be automatically interpreted with respect to it.  The document date (<code rend="inline">docdate</code>) is stored in the meta section at the top of the XML output file.  Use the <code rend="inline">head</code> command to list the first 5 lines of the output file where you can see it:</p>

                    <p>If the document date is not specified all temporal expressions will be interpreted relative to the date when the Geoparser is run.  While this setting does not affect the performance of the geo-resolution of place names in this release, one could imagine a possible extension where the document date affects the type of gazetteer used or the location name variants that should be considered as place names change over time.</p>

                    <head>Extracting Geo-Resolution Output to TSV</head>
                    <p>The output of the Geoparser is in XML format. This is useful as XML can store various types of information present in text along with it.  For example, it can store low-level information like the boundaries of words, their part-of-speech tags and lemmas.  It can also store more complex information like phrases and entities occurring in the text as well as links between them, for example the subject and object of a sentence or the location (e.g. birthplace) of a person.  The advantage is that all the computed structural and linguistic information computed for a piece of text is stored along with it and downstream natural language processing tools have all the information available.</p>
                    <p>While XML is easy to process by a machine it is difficult to read by human readers. You may also not be interested in all the information computed by the Geoparser and might only want to see which locations were identified along with their coordinates. So rather than dealing with an XML file, you might find it easier to work with the Geoparser output in a form such as tab-separated values (TSV) in order to inspect it in a spreadsheet or use it with an application such as QGIS or Google Maps/Google Earth for which there are already useful Programming Historian lessons available (<ref target="/en/lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</ref> and <ref target="/en/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth">Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The Geoparser is distributed with a useful set of XML processing tools called <ref target="https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/ltxml2/">LT-XML2</ref>, authored by Richard Tobin, which can be used to extract the location entities in a Geoparser XML output file and to present them in tab-separated value (TSV) format. The executables for these tools are located in the <code rend="inline">./geoparser/bin</code> directory, inside:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>

                    <p>All the executables starting with <emph>lx</emph> are LT-XML tools which work in combination with Xpath expressions to process or manipulate XML.  Going in detail over Xpath is beyond the scope of this lesson, so I will give clear examples to show how things work.  If you are interested in XML data manipulation you will find further detail in <ref target="/en/lessons/transforming-xml-with-xsl">Transforming Data for Reuse and Re-publication</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The best tool for printing XML content in a different format is <code rend="inline">lxprintf</code>. Depending on your operating system, go to the <code rend="inline">geoparser</code> directory and run <code rend="inline">lxprintf</code> as follows:</p>
                    <p>On Linux use:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_22" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_22.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>and on MacOSX type:</p>

                    </ab>
                    <p>The previous <code rend="inline">lxprintf</code> command reads through a geo-parsed XML output file, extracts all location entities identified by the Geoparser and presents them in TSV format. In the example above, the XML input file (containing the location entities) is <code rend="inline">./out/172172.out.xml</code>, and the TSV file is <code rend="inline">./out/172172.out.tsv</code>. The <code rend="inline">&lt;</code> symbol signifies "standard in" (or stdin) which tells the script to read in the file that follows it and the <code rend="inline">&gt;</code> symbol signifies standard out (or stdout) which specifies sending the output to the file that follows it.</p>
                    <p>The way this command works is that lxprintf looks for XML entities specified after the option <code rend="inline">-e</code>.  In this case, entities of type location are to be extracted (<code rend="inline">"ent[@type='location’]”</code>).  Here is an example of an entity of type location in the XML:</p>

                        <item>
                            <code rend="inline">"normalize-space(parts)"</code> refers to the location mention recognised in the text. normalize() removes any unnecessary whitespace.</item>
                        <item>
                            <code rend="inline">"@gazref”</code> refers to the ID reference of the location in the gazetteer, if resolved.</item>
                        <item>
                            <code rend="inline">"@in-country”</code> refers to the country the location appears in, if this information was identified.</item>
                        <item>
                            <code rend="inline">"@lat”</code> refers to the latitude of the location, if this information was identified.</item>
                        <item>
                            <code rend="inline">"@long”</code> refers to the longitude of the location, if this information was identified.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>When printed to screen, the content of the TSV output file is therefore the following:</p>

                        <code xml:id="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_25" corresp="code_geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh_25.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>If you open <code rend="inline">./out/172172.out.tsv</code> in Excel, for example, you can see that the information is now presented in column format, in this case listing the place name, the GeoNames ID, the country code, the latitude and the longitude (see Figure 8).</p>

                        <graphic url="geoparser_figure10.png"/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Once you have extracted the geo-location information from the <code rend="inline">*out.xml</code> file(s) you can read it into a data frame and use it as input into your favourite mapping tool though you will have to adjust the format depending on your needs.</p>

                <p>The Geoparser and its demo were developed over a number of years in a team effort by members of the <ref target="https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Language Technology Group</ref>, including Claire Grover, Richard Tobin, Kate Byrne and myself (Beatrice Alex).</p>

                <p>The Geoparser team also welcomes suggestions for future collaboration to tailor the Geoparser to different needs.  Please get in touch if you have ideas about how it could be applied.</p>
                <p>In the past the Geoparser was used to identify place names for different purposes and in different types of data (e.g. Grover et al., 2010 and Alex et al., 2015).  For example, it was adapted to perform fine-grained geo-parsing for literature set in Edinburgh (<ref target="http://palimpsest.blogs.edina.ac.uk/">Palimpsest</ref>) presented in the <ref target="http://litlong.org/">LitLong</ref> interface.  It was used to geo-parse</p>

                <p>The Geoparser was also adapted to the ancient world for the <ref target="https://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/">Google Ancient Places</ref> project (e.g. see Isaksen et al., 2011), with its <ref target="http://nrabinowitz.github.io/gapvis/">GapVis</ref>  interface. More recently, the Geoparser was used to geo-parse Twitter user profile locations (Alex et al, 2016) and the mass digitised text, including the Gazetteers of Scotland (Filgueira et al., 2020) and Encyclopaedia Britannica (Filgueira et al., 2021)</p>
