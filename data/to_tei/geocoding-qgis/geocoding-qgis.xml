                <head>Lesson Goals</head>
                <p>Many types of sources used by historians are inherently spatial. For example:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Census, population or taxation data</item>
                    <item>Imports and exports</item>
                    <item>Routes and itineraries</item>
                </list>
                <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to 'geocode' historial data containing placenames (towns, counties, countries, etc), thus making them mappable using <ref target="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</ref>, a digital mapping software suite. This will allow you to:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Display your data as a map (whether it originated as a list, table, or prose)</item>
                    <item>Analyse distances between locations in your data</item>
                    <item>View and analyse geographical distribution within your data</item>
                </list>
                <p>This tutorial forms part of the Mapping and GIS series on <emph>Programming Historian</emph>, and builds upon skills you will have learned in earlier tutorials, especially <ref target="/lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</ref>. It presumes that you have a set of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</ref> relevant to the region for which you intend to produce a map, and data that you would like to get into those shapefiles so that it can be visualised and analysed.</p>

                <head>About Geocoding</head>
                <p>Mapping data such as these involves rendering spatial information which humans can understand (such as names of towns or counties) into a format that can be understood by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</ref> (mapping) software. This is limited to some kind of geometry (a point, line or polygon in a vector representation) relating to the coordinates of this place in two dimensional space – these might be latitude and longitude expressed in degrees, or as is often the case in the UK, eastings and northings of the <ref target="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/resources/maps-and-geographic-resources/the-national-grid.html">British National Grid</ref>. Geocoding always depends on the use of a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer">gazetter</ref>, or list of places and coordinates.</p>
                <p>There is often confusion between processes of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoding</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeference">georeferencing</ref>.</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Georeferencing refers to placing visual elements, usually raster images such as satellite photographs, scans of old maps, or some types of vector image such as architectural or archaeological drawings, into geographical space. This involves specifying latitude, longitude coordinates, and scale.</item>
                    <item>Geocoding is the process of resolving addresses (or some other kind of spatial description) which form part of a dataset into geometries on a map. This gives the ability to view, analyse and query that dataset spatially.</item>
                </list>
                <p>In many modern applications geocoding is completed automatically, often using the mapping tools and gazetters offered seamlessly as part of <ref target="https://www.google.co.uk/maps">Google Maps</ref> or <ref target="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</ref>. When working with contemporary data, or data from relatively recent periods, and Western European or North American historical contexts, this is often sufficient. If you are using data containing place names that are consistent with the present day, you can use the QGIS web geocoder plugin detailed in the postscript to this tutorial, or the <ref target="/lessons/geoparsing-text-with-edinburgh">Edinburgh Geoparser</ref>.</p>
                <p>Many historians will be working on contexts where the place names in their data do not match the present day. Remember that street names tend to change relatively frequently, either in terms of spelling or entirely. Administrative areas have changed relatively frequently and were sometimes used inconsistently in historical sources (e.g. was Bristol in Gloucestershire, Somerset, City of Bristol, Avon?) and indeed places have moved between countries, and countries have changed in name and extent. Even town names have changed and are subject to linguistic ambiguities (e.g. <emph>Lynn Episcopi</emph>, Bishop's Lynn, Lynn, King's Lynn, Kings Lynn). For these reasons it is often better to avoid using automated online geocoding tools and create a gazetteer to suit the historical context which you are researching. The processes described in this tutorial are manual, and can be modified and applied to almost any geographical or historical context.</p>

                <head>Lesson Structure</head>
                <p>This lesson is divided into two main sections:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Part 1: <hi rend="bold">Joining tables</hi>, which is a simple way of mapping simple summary data such as totals or averages</item>
                    <item>Part 2: <hi rend="bold">Geocoding full datasets</hi>, which maps each item of data to a location, allowing much more flexibility, detailed spatial analysis, and more interesting maps</item>
                </list>
                <p>At the end of the tutorial there is a note on using automated geocoding tools which are available to work with modern addresses, but these are of limited relevance to historians working on eras before the late nineteenth or twentieth centuries.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="2">
                <head>Getting Started</head>
                <p>This tutorial assumes that you have installed QGIS version 2 or newer and have followed the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> tutorial <ref target="/lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</ref> by Jim Clifford, Josh MacFadyen and Daniel Macfarlane. Or, at least that you are familiar with the process of adding vector layers in QGIS.</p>
                <p>This tutorial was prepared using QGIS 2.14 'Essen' on Mac OS X 10.11. Menus, windows, and options might appear slightly different on different platforms or versions, but it should not be difficult to translate any differences. At a few points in the tutorial reference is made to how these techniques could be applied using <ref target="https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html">ArcGIS</ref>, which is the industry standard commercial GIS application, and is widely available at universities, but is not always superior to QGIS.</p>
                <p>You will also need to use a relational database such as Microsoft Access or <ref target="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/">LibreOffice Base</ref>, or alternatively be very proficient with spreadsheets. The instructions in the tutorial are designed for use with LibreOffice Base, which is a free download as part of the <ref target="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/">LibreOffice</ref> suite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">NB</hi> LibreOffice requires a full installation of Java in order to use the Base application. This is achieved most easily by downloading and installing the Java 8 Development Kit for your operating system from <ref target="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Oracle</ref>. The Java 8 Runtime Environment does NOT work with LibreOffice on Mac OS X 10.11.</p>
                <p>The tutorial will map the data extracted from <ref target="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni-oxon/1500-1714">
                        <emph>Alumni Oxonienses</emph>
                    </ref> in the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson <ref target="/lessons/extracting-keywords">Using Gazetteers to Extract Sets of Keywords from Free-Flowing Texts</ref> using publically available maps of English and Welsh historic counties. If you complete that tutorial first it will help you to understand the nature of the data which is being mapped here. These data are provided as both a full dataset and also a separate file which is a summary of the numbers of Oxford alumni by their county of origin, created from the first file using an Excel PivotTable.</p>

                <h2>Part 1: Joining Tables and Maps</h2>
                <p>The simplest way to map historical data is to 'join' (connect) a table of data containing place names to a layer of map features with the same names. This technique is commonly used by historians to create a map depicting a set of descriptive statistics for a set of data, for instance the number of individuals within a group originating from each county, or the proportion of inhabitants of each county working in a certain industry.</p>
                <p>However, joining tables to features in GIS only works on a one-to-one basis (or at least only one-to-one relationships can be used to define the appearance of the map). This means that each map feature can only have one value associated with each of its attributes. You can say there are 50 students from the county Essex in your data, and thus link that to the Essex polygon feature in your shapefile (Table 1). But you cannot store the data as 50 rows, each of which represents a single student that points to the Essex feature in your shapefile (Table 2). One shapefile feature, one value. For this reason, joins are best suited to representing the results of analysis completed in a spreadsheet or database (eg, when you have already calculated the sum of people from a particular area - or whatever value you want to map).</p>
                <p>
                    <emph>Table 1: This table would work for 'joins', as each shapefile has a calculated value.</emph>

                <p>In this short tutorial we will map the total numbers of early modern University of Oxford alumni from each county. The file <code rend="inline">AlumniCounties.csv</code> contains a summary of the full dataset which has already been created using a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table">PivotTable</ref> in Microsoft Excel. Take a look at this file using your spreadsheet software to look at the column titles and the nature of the data contained in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <emph>NB</emph>: QGIS is very sensitive to correct formatting of Comma Separated Values (CSV) files, specifically the type of line breaks. If you have difficulties using a CSV file created using Microsoft Excel (especially Excel 2007 or 2011 for MacOS) try re-saving the CSV file using LibreOffice Calc or Excel 2016.</p>

                        <item>Set up a new Project file in QGIS and save it in your choice of location. (<emph>NB.</emph> QGIS defaults to saving 'relative pathnames' which means that as long as you save all of your project files in the same folder or its subfolders, you can move it to a different location, such as a USB stick. You can check this setting via the menu <code rend="inline">Project&gt;Project Properties</code> and the <code rend="inline">General</code> side tab).</item>
                        <item>It is very important to set the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">Coordinate Reference System</ref> (CRS) to one that suits the data you will import, and the location you plan to map. Go to the menu <code rend="inline">Project&gt;Project Properties</code> and select the 'CRS' tab at the side.

                    </list>
                    <p>There is an important distinction between Geographic Coordinate Systems, which simply define measurement units and the datum, and Projected Coordinate Systems, which also define the way in which the globe is ‘flattened’ onto a map. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid">OSGB</ref> is available in both variants in QGIS, so choose the 'projected' version to get a map in which the United Kingdom appears the shape you would expect.

                    <p>You should now see an outline map of British counties in a random colour. If you right-click on the name of this layer in the Layers Panel (shown by default on the bottom left) you can select <code rend="inline">Open Attribute Table</code> to view the database properties already associated with each feature on the map. Notice that the name of each county is named in three different ways, the fullest of which is in the column called <code rend="inline">NAME</code>, as well as two ID columns. We now need to join this to the alumni data that we want to map using the fact that the values in the <code rend="inline">NAME</code> column are the same as those in one of the columns in our spreadsheet (they must be exactly the same for this to work).</p>
                    <p>The file <code rend="inline">AlumniCounties.csv</code> contains a summary of the alumni dataset created using a PivotTable in Microsoft Excel. Two named columns contain county names (this column is called <code rend="inline">Row Labels</code>) and simple totals of individuals originating in those places.</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>In QGIS select the <code rend="inline">Add Delimited Text Layer</code> button from the Manage Layers toolbox (looks like a large comma symbol).

The <code rend="inline">Join field</code> is <code rend="inline">Row Labels</code> in this case, and the <code rend="inline">Target field</code> is the field in the map layer’s attribute table which contains the corresponding information (in this case <code rend="inline">NAME</code>).</item>
                        <item>You can check that this join has worked by right-clicking on the shapefile layer and choosing <code rend="inline">Open Attribute Table</code>.

QGIS offers a very wide range of style options to convey the data associated with each map element in a graphical form. The style called <code rend="inline">Graduated</code>  allows you to create a choropleth map with a colour gradient repesenting the range of numerical values in your data, while <code rend="inline">Categorised</code> allows you to assign colours or other visual styles to specific or text values in your tables. For data such as these, with many different values within a logical range, the <code rend="inline">graduated</code> style of representation is appropriate; if there were just a limited range of potential values, these could be displayed more effectively using the <code rend="inline">categorized</code> option.</p>

                    <p>For more information on choosing the correct classification method for your data, start by looking at this article on <ref target="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Classification">Classification in GIS</ref>. Examine the results of your map and think about what is actually being represented. Are the raw numbers of alumni, coloured according to the same classes, for very differently sized counties, helpful? Choropleth maps should normally display data that has been normalised in some way, for example showing population density, rather than raw population.</p>
                    <p>You may wish to experiment with the Expression Builder (accessed via the ∑ symbol next to <code rend="inline">Column</code> in <code rend="inline">Properties&gt;Style</code>) to normalise these values using other columns and values that are available to you. Ideally we might normalise by population, but in the absence of this data, you might experiment by using the <code rend="inline">$area</code> property, which is intrinsic to polygon shape layers in GIS. The very simple expression needed to create a map colour ramp on this would be (note that the field name contains spaces, so needs to be contained within double quotation marks):</p>

                    <h2>Part 2: Geocoding Historical Data</h2>
                    <p>Geocoding is a much more powerful technique than simple table joins because each and every line of your data remains visible and able to be analysed within the GIS software as an individual point on the map (as in table 2). Fundamentally the aim is to join each item of data to a pair of coordinates. Most historical data cannot be geocoded automatically using online tools or QGIS plugins. The geocoding process must therefore be carried out manually to match each data row with a location. This is a simple database operation joining (matching) your data with a gazetteer (a list of places with coordinates). Many gazetteers are available, but relatively few are suitable for use with historical data, for example, for England:</p>

For some parts of the world there are neither historical gazetters, nor vector maps suitable for historical periods, in these cases you will have to investigate creating your own vector and point layer; see the tutorial <ref target="/lessons/vector-layers-qgis">Creating New Vector Layers in QGIS 2.0</ref>.</p>

                    <p>We can now create a composite table of these locations and the data from our original table. This is created by matching the name of the county in the 'place' field of the alumni table with its equivalent in the new gazetteer using a relational database. This tutorial assumes that you have many hundreds or thousands or rows of data (as we do in this tutorial), requiring an automated method. If you only have a few rows, or you have difficulties using these methods, it is possible to do it manually - see 'Geocoding your own Historical Data' below.</p>
                    <p>In simple scenarios (such as this one where we are only matching a single 'place' attribute – i.e. only 'county') it is possible to code your data to a gazetteer using the <ref target="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/VLOOKUP-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1">VLOOKUP</ref> function in Microsoft Excel (or equivalent spreadsheets) or even using the <ref target="http://michaelminn.com/linux/mmqgis/">MMQGIS</ref> plugin within QGIS. However, in most practical scenarios you will probably wish to match  on several attributes simultaneously (for instance town, county and country – you would want to distinguish between Sudbury, Suffolk, England; Sudbury, Derbyshire, England; Sudbury, Middlesex, England; and Sudbury, Ontario, Canada). This can be achieved in a somewhat cumbersome way using the <ref target="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/INDEX-function-a5dcf0dd-996d-40a4-a822-b56b061328bd">INDEX</ref> function in Excel, but is more practical, and extensible, in a relational database such as Microsoft Access or LibreOffice Base.</p>
                    <p>This tutorial uses LibreOffice, which is an Open Source alternative to Microsoft Office and is available for Windows, Mac OS X and all variants of Linux etc (NB it requires a full Java installation). It includes a relational database application on all platforms, unlike Microsoft Access which is available only in the Windows version of Office. However, it is quite restricted in its functionality. If you use Microsoft Access, or are a very proficient spreadsheet user, please feel free to replicate this process using your preferred software.</p>

                    <p>When you add data that has been geocoded as points in this way, you only initially see a single point in each location. Because each row of data has been geocoded with exactly the same coordinates, they overlap and you can't immediately see how many there are.</p>
                    <p>There are several ways to display this data in ways that are more meaningful, and in this regard QGIS has many advantages over the leading commercial software ArcGIS. The most basic way that this can be achieved by creating a new polygon layer containing a new column with a count of points contained within each polygon (this feature is equivalent to a spatial join in ArcGIS). The result of this method would be essentially the same as summarising your data externally (in a database or spreadsheet) and then performing a table join.</p>

                    <p>A more useful way of depicting the geocoded data is to use QGIS's advanced display styles such as Heatmap or Point Displacement (these features are laborious to replicate in ArcGIS, and involve creating 'representations' in parallel to layers). Point Displacement is probably the most appropriate way to explore this particular data. The advantage of displaying your data using styles, rather than mapping a summary created externally in a spreadsheet using a table join (as in part 1 of this tutorial), or creating a copy of your polygons containing a count of points that had been inside them using the previous steps,  is that the layer remains dynamic.</p>

Remember the sizes remain constant regardless of the zoom level, so zoom in to see the results more clearly.</item>
                        <item>The Heat Map style is another popular way of representing concentrations of points like this.

                        <item>You can use the options here to change the colour scale, while the <code rend="inline">Radius</code> option controls the size of the 'glow' around each point - when this is set to a high figure, nearby concentrations of points merge together, creating a more organic appearance (but you should think carefully as to whether this presents an accurate impression of your data).</item>

                    <p>You have now completed the geocoding process, and can enjoy the advantages of being able to analyse this inherently spatial historical data in a spatial way. In a real world scenario, you would probably only geocode data which is more precise than simple county level, giving a good deal more analytical potential and making maps plotted more meaningful. Where you have data which can be geocoded to a high – and crucially consistent – level of precision, it is possible to conduct a wide range of geographical analyses such as measures of clustering or distances.</p>
                    <p>For example, you can easily tweak and refine which records are mapped by changing the definition query in the properties of your geocoded layer (Right click on <code rend="inline">GeocodedAlumni</code> in Layers Panel and select <code rend="inline">Layer Properties&gt;General&gt;Provider Feature Filter&gt;Query Builder</code>). You can use the less than or greater than operators to define years and see if trends change over time, or use the <ref target="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp">SQL LIKE</ref> statement to query the ‘details’ column to filter particular colleges – did they tend to attract students from particular counties? These queries use standard <ref target="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/">SQL language</ref> and can be combined with <code rend="inline">AND</code>, <code rend="inline">NOT</code> etc. This example would select only those students who had matriculated at Magdalen College:</p>

Ensure that the same conventions are followed in both your data and your gazetteer, especially with regard to punctuation (e.g. ‘Devon’ or ‘Devonshire’, ‘Hay-on-Wye’, or ‘Hay on Wye’ etc.) If you are lucky enough to have data which is presented in modern format (i.e. modern countries, streets or even postcodes), it is possible to use the much easier process of automated geocoding. See the section below.</p>
                    <p>If you only have a small number of rows in your data, or if you are having difficulty standardising your location information in one field so that it can be geocoded using the methods in this tutorial, you should remember that it is possible to do this process manually. Simply use one of many online geocoding tools to manually find the X and Y coordinates for each row of your data directly into X and Y columns in your spreadsheet or database. Remember to note the coordinate system used by the tool you use to find these coordinates though (probably WGS1984)! If you have manually geocoded data like this, simply follow the instructions above from 'Adding Geocoded Data to QGIS'</p>

                    <head>Troubleshooting Database Gazetteer Joins</head>
                    <p>While relational database queries are very powerful tools for doing customised geocoding, by allowing you to match multiple criteria simultaneously, they can also present misleading results if not checked carefully. Any data that is not matched will usually be ignored 'silently' (i.e. you will not see an error message), so it is important to check whether the total number of lines in your results matches that in your original data.</p>
                    <p>If there are too few results, this means some values cannot be matched. In this table, for example, <code rend="inline">Place of origin</code> includes values such as 'London' and 'Germany', which do not match any of the places in the gazetteer that we created. You could either conclude that the lower number of results is acceptable, or try to correct it by either altering places of origin, or adding locations to your gazetteer manually. Changing the properties of the join between the two tables from <code rend="inline">Inner Join</code> to <code rend="inline">Right Join</code> will ensure that ALL records from the alumni table are returned, whether or not there is matching data from the gazetteer <code rend="inline">counties</code> table (presuming that the alumni table is on the right). This is a very useful diagnostic step.</p>
                    <p>If there are too many results, then each row in one table is matching multiple rows in the other. This is actually quite common with gazetteers, as there are likely to be duplicate points with the same, or very similar, place names in many datasets. This is especially true of very high resolution gazetteers which might have many neighbourhoods within a town individually located, but it is the 'town' column that you might want to match against. To guard against stray duplicates like this, you can use database functions to ensure only a single result is returned from your gazetteer. If you encounter this problem you should first create a query which uses the <code rend="inline">minimum</code> or <code rend="inline">maximum</code> functions (called sum functions in Access) on the ID field of your gazetteer, together with the <code rend="inline">group by</code> function on the name field of your gazetteer, to isolate only a single occurence of each place name. You can then treat this as a subquery and add it to your existing query and join the now unique ID field to the existing gazetteer field using an <code rend="inline">Inner Join</code> to ensure only one occurrence of each place name is matched.</p>
                    <h2>Postscript: Geocoding Modern Addresses</h2>
                    <p>If you have data which contains present-day addresses (such as postal addresses using contemporary street names, post or ZIP codes, or higher-level descriptions such as town or county names that follow modern conventions) then geocoding is very easy, using online tools or tools that use online <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</ref>. Remember that online geocoding is unlikely to work if any of these elements of an address are not consistent with the present day.</p>
                    <p>Major online mapping providers such as Google, Bing, and OpenStreetMap all offer API (Application Programming Interface) connections to their highly sophisticated geocoding tools. These are the same tools that power the map search features of these websites, so are very effective at making 'best guess' decisions on ambiguous or incomplete addresses. It is worth noting that when accessed via an API, rather than their normal website, it will be necessary to provide country names as part of the address.</p>

                        <item>Google provides two web based tools that allow direct use of their geocoding tools as well as their cartography: <ref target="https://www.google.com/maps/d/">Google My Maps</ref> and <ref target="https://fusiontables.google.com">Google Fusion Tables</ref>. Both allow the upload of spreadsheets containing address columns, which are automatically geocoded.</item>
                        <item>Within QGIS these APIs are available to geocode data via a number of dedicated plugins. Currently (February 2017) the most popular and well supported of these is MMQGIS.</item>
