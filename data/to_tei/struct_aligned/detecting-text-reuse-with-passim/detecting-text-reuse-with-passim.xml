    <body><p>In this lesson you will be introduced to the automatic detection of text reuse with the Passim library. You will learn how to install and run Passim and its dependencies, how to prepare your texts as input files suitable for use with Passim and, finally, how to process the output generated by Passim to carry out basic analyses.</p>
<p>This lesson targets digital humanities (DH) practitioners without any prior knowledge of text reuse, but with a working knowledge of <link target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash scripting</link> and Python as well as some data manipulation. For tutorials on bash scripting and <link target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</link>, you can refer to the Programming Historian <link target="/en/lessons/intro-to-bash">“Introduction to the Bash Command Line</link> tutorial and the <link target="/en/lessons/?topic=python">library of current Python lessons</link> on the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> website.</p>
<p>This lesson includes an overview of <link target="https://github.com/dasmiq/passim">Passim</link>, an open source tool for automatic text reuse detection. While the tool has been used in a number of small and large DH projects, it lacks a user-friendly documentation with examples and set up instructions, a gap that we aim to fill with this <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson.</p>
<div type="2" n="1"><head>Introduction to Text Reuse</head>
<p>Text reuse can be defined as "the meaningful reiteration of text, usually beyond the simple repetition of common language" (Romanello et al. 2014). It is such a broad concept that it can be understood at different levels and studied in a large variety of contexts. In a publishing or teaching context, for example, instances of text reuse can constitute plagiarism should portions of someone else’s text be repeated without appropriate attribution. In the context of literary studies, text reuse is often just a synonym for literary phenomena like allusions, paraphrases and direct quotations.</p>
<p>The following list includes just some of the libraries available that perform automatic text reuse detection:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <link target="https://docs.ropensci.org/textreuse/">R textreuse package</link> (R) written by Lincoln Mullen</li>
<li><link target="https://www.etrap.eu/research/tracer/">TRACER</link> (Java) developed by Marco Büchler and colleagues</li>
<li><link target="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)</link></li>
<li><link target="https://github.com/tesserae/tesserae">Tesserae</link> (PHP, Perl)</li>
<li><link target="https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/text-pair">TextPAIR (Pairwise Alignment for Intertextual Relations)</link></li>
<li><link target="https://github.com/dasmiq/passim">Passim</link> (Scala) developed by <link target="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/">David Smith</link> (Northeastern University)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this tutorial we chose the Passim library for three main reasons. Firstly, it can be adapted to a variety of use cases as it works well on a small text collection as well as on a large-scale corpus. Secondly, while the documentation for Passim is extensive, because of its relatively advanced user audience, a more user-centered step-by-step tutorial about detecting text reuse with Passim would be beneficial to the user community. Lastly, the following examples illustrate the variety of scenarios in which text reuse is a useful methodology:</p>
<ul>
<li>To determine whether a digital library contains multiple editions of the same work(s)</li>
<li>To find quotations in a text, provided that the target works are known (e.g. find quotations of the Bible within 17c English literature)  </li>
<li>To study the virality and spread of texts (e.g. <link target="https://viraltexts.org/">Viral Texts</link> by Cordell and Smith for historical newspapers)</li>
<li>To identify (and possibly filter out) duplicate documents within a text collection before performing further processing steps (e.g. topic modelling as illustrated by Schofield et al. (2017))</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, Passim is usually a great choice. It will help you automate the search for repeated text passages in a corpus — whether these are running ads in newspapers, multiple copies of the same poem, or direct (and slightly indirect) quotations in someone else's book.
Text reuse detection as implemented in Passim aims at identifying these copies and repetitions automatically, and yields clusters of passages that were deemed to be related with one another. Ultimately, what a cluster contains can vary a lot and will depend on your research question. For example, Passim can group together copies of the same article that differ only with respect to optical character recognition (OCR) errors, but it can also help to retrieve texts that share the same journalistic template, such as horoscopes or advertisements.</p>
</div><div type="2" n="2"><head>Prerequisites</head>
<p>This tutorial requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic understanding of Bash scripts. For readers needing a review on Bash scripts, read the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson <link target="/en/lessons/intro-to-bash">"Introduction to the Bash Command Line"</link>.</li>
<li>Knowledge of JSON. To learn more about JSON, read the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson <link target="/en/lessons/json-and-jq">"Reshaping JSON with jq"</link>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, while a basic understanding of Python — and a working Python installation — are not strictly needed to work with Passim, they are required to run some parts of this tutorial (e.g. the Jupyter notebook with data exploration, or the Early English Books Online (EEBO) data preparation script). If you are not familiar with Python, please read the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson <link target="/en/lessons/introduction-and-installation">"Python Introduction and Installation"</link>.   </p>
<p>Note that installing Passim on Windows is more arduous than macOS or Linux. As a result, we recommend using macOS or Linux (or a virtual environment) for this lesson.</p>
</div><div type="2" n="3"><head>Installing Passim</head>
<p>Installing Passim requires installing the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li><link target="https://www.java.com/fr/download/">Java JDK (version 8)</link></li>
<li><link target="https://www.scala-sbt.org/">Scala Build Tool (SBT)</link></li>
<li><link target="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</link></li>
</ul>
<p>But why are all these dependencies needed?</p>
<p>Passim is written in a programming language called Scala. To execute a software written in Scala, its sources need to be compiled into an executable JAR file, which is performed by <code type="inline">sbt</code>, Scala's interactive build tool. Finally, since Passim is designed to work also on large-scale text collections (with several thousands or millions of documents), behind the scenes it uses Spark, a cluster-computing framework written in Java. Using Spark allows Passim to handle the distributed processing of certain parts of the code, which is useful when handling large amounts of data. The <link target="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html#glossary">Spark glossary</link> is a useful resource to learn basic Spark terminology (words like "driver", "executor", etc.) but learning this terminology may not be necessary if you are running Passim on a small dataset.</p>
<p>Before installing this set of software, you'll need to download the Passim version 1 source code from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_0" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_0.txt"/></pre>
<p>or download the source code <link target="https://github.com/dasmiq/passim/releases/tag/v1.0.0">from the v1.0 release page</link>.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, we recommend reading the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson <link target="https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0051">"An Introduction to Version Control Using GitHub Desktop"</link>.</p>
<div type="3" n="3.1"><head>macOS instructions</head>
<p>These instructions are aimed at users of Apple's macOS and were tested under version 10.13.4 (a.k.a. High Sierra).</p>
<div type="4" n="3.1.1"><head>Check Java Installation</head>
<p>Ensure that you have Java Development Kit 8 by typing the following command in a new Terminal window:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_1" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_1.txt"/></pre>
<p>If the output of this command looks similar to the following example, then Java 8 is installed on your machine.</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_2" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_2.txt"/></pre>
</div><div type="4" n="3.1.2"><head>Installing Java 8</head>
<p>In case another version of Java is installed on your machine, follow the following steps to install Java 8 alongside the existing Java version.</p>
<p>This is important so as not to break already installed software that needs more recent Java versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the <code type="inline">brew</code> package manager by following installation instructions on the <link target="https://brew.sh/">Brew.sh</link> website. Once the installation is completed, run <code type="inline">brew --help</code> to verify it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code type="inline">brew</code> to install Java 8.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_3" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_3.txt"/></pre>
<p>Verify that Java 8 is installed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_4" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_4.txt"/></pre>
<p>This command should output something similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_5" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_5.txt"/></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Install <code type="inline">jenv</code>, a tool that allows you to manage multiple Java versions installed on the same machine, and to easily switch between them.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_6" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_6.txt"/></pre>
<p>To be able to call <code type="inline">jenv</code> without specifying the executable's full path don't forget to add <code type="inline">jenv</code> to your <code type="inline">$PATH</code> environment variable by opening the file <code type="inline">~/.bashrc</code> with your favorite text editor and adding the following lines at the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_7" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_7.txt"/></pre>
<p>After adding these lines, you need to open another terminal window or run the following line so that the <code type="inline">$PATH</code> variable is updated with the change you just made (the command <code type="inline">source</code> triggers the reload of your <code type="inline">bash</code> configuration).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_8" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_8.txt"/></pre>
<p>Once installed, add the existing Java versions to <code type="inline">jenv</code> (i.e. those listed by the command <code type="inline">/usr/libexec/java_home -V</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_9" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_9.txt"/></pre>
<p>Now you can set the default version of Java for this project by running the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_10" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_10.txt"/></pre>
</div><div type="4" n="3.1.3"><head>Compiling Passim From the Sources (macOS)</head>
<p>Passim is written in a programming language called Scala. Before being able to execute a software written in Scala, its sources need to be compiled. This task is performed by <code type="inline">sbt</code>, the Interactive Build Tool.</p>
<p>To determine whether <code type="inline">sbt</code> is installed on your machine, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_11" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_11.txt"/></pre>
<p>If this command prints <code type="inline">bash: sbt: command not found</code> it means <code type="inline">sbt</code> is not installed.
However, Passim comes with a useful script (<code type="inline">build/sbt</code>) that will download and install SBT automatically before compiling the sources from Passim.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">NB</hi>: Using an external (i.e. already installed) SBT may lead to issues, we recommend the following method for compiling Passim.</p>
<p>To compile the program, run the following command from the directory where you've previously cloned Passim's GH repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_12" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_12.txt"/></pre>
<p>This command will take some time (around 3 minutes on a modern connection), but will let you know of the progress. As your computer starts downloading required files, a log will be printed on screen. At the end of this process, <code type="inline">sbt</code> will have created a <code type="inline">.jar</code> archive contaning the compiled sources for Passim. This file is found in the <code type="inline">target</code> directory: <code type="inline">target/scala-2.11/Passim_2.11-0.2.0.jar</code>. Depending on the version of Scala and Passim, the actual path might be slightly different on your computer.</p>
<p>The <code type="inline">bin</code> directory contains a Passim file: this is the executable that will launch Passim. In order for your computer the location of this file, and thus for it to recognise the Passim command, we need to add the path to the <code type="inline">PATH</code> environment variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_13" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_13.txt"/></pre>
<p>To add the path permanently to the <code type="inline">PATH</code> environment variable, open the file <code type="inline">~/.bashrc</code> with your favorite text editor and add the following line anywhere in the file (then execute <code type="inline">source ~/.bashrc</code> to apply this change):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_14" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_14.txt"/></pre>
</div><div type="4" n="3.1.4"><head>Installing Spark</head>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the <link target="http://spark.apache.org/downloads">download section</link> of the Spark website and select Spark release version '3.x.x' (where '<emph>x</emph>' means any version that starts with '3.'), and package type 'Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7' from the dropdown menus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract the compressed binaries to a directory of your choice (e.g. <code type="inline">/Applications</code>):</p>

<p>These instructions are aimed at Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.). If you run another type of distribution (Fedora, Gentoo, etc.), replace the distribution-specific commands (eg <code type="inline">apt</code>) with those used by your specific distribution.</p>
<div type="4" n="3.2.1"><head>Check Java Installation</head>

</div></div><div type="3" n="3.3"><head>Verify the Installation</head>
<p>At this point you have installed Passim and all required packages on your machine. If you type <code type="inline">Passim --help</code> in the command line, you should see output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_27" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_27.txt"/></pre>
</div></div><div type="2" n="4"><head>Preparing Data for Passim</head>
<p>The goal of using Passim is to automate the search for repeated text passages in a corpus. For example, a newspaper corpus contains multiple copies of the same article, identical or with slight differences from one another, as well as repetitions of smaller portions of a newspaper page (e.g. advertisement, event listings, etc.).</p>
<p>As the documentation for Passim specifies "the input to Passim is a set of documents. Depending on the kind of data you have, you might choose documents to be whole books, pages of books, whole issues of newspapers, individual newspaper articles, etc. Minimally, a document consists of an identifier string and a single string of text content" (Refer to the minimal JSON input example in the next section for more information about the structure of input for Passim).</p>
<p>Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of input and output data for Passim. Given an input set of documents, divided into document series, Passim will attempt to identify reuse of text from documents in different series, and not within these series. In the case of a newspaper corpus, articles from the same newspaper will belong to the same document series, as we are not interested in detecting reuse within the same newspaper, but across different newspapers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what constitutes a document, and how these documents should be divided into series, are the choices you'll need to make when preparing your data for Passim.  Naturally, the decision on what constitutes a <emph>series</emph> of documents is directly dependent on your goals or research questions. Finding quotations of the Bible in a corpus of books is a "one-to-many" case of text reuse detection, which requires documents to be grouped into two series (<code type="inline">bible</code> and <code type="inline">non_bible</code>). Instead, the comparison between multiple editions of the Bible (also known as collation) can be seen a "many-to-many" case, where each edition will correspond to and constitute a series of documents (e.g. pages).  If your research questions change at some point, thus requiring a re-definition of document series, you will need also to produce new input data for Passim to reflect this change.</p>
<figure><desc>Figure 1. Schematic representation of text reuse clusters; each cluster consists of similar passages found in several series of documents.</desc><graphic url="textreuse-generic.png"/></figure>
<div type="3" n="4.1"><head>Basic JSON format</head>
<p>The input format for Passim consists of JSON documents in the <link target="http://jsonlines.org/">JSON lines format</link> (i.e. each line of text contains a single JSON document).</p>
<p>The following file content for a file named <code type="inline">test.json</code> illustrates a minimal example of the input format for Passim: </p>
<pre><code class="language-json" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_28" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_28.txt"/></pre>
<p>The fields <code type="inline">id</code>, <code type="inline">series</code> and <code type="inline">text</code> are the only fields required by Passim. Given this file as input, the software will try to detect text reuse between documents in the series <code type="inline">abc</code> and those in the series <code type="inline">def</code>, on the basis of the contents in <code type="inline">text</code>.</p>
<p>Throughout this tutorial we will be using the command-line tool <link target="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><code type="inline">jq</code></link> to inspect and do some basic process on both input and output JSON data. Note that, if you don't have <code type="inline">jq</code> installed, you'll need to execute <code type="inline">sudo apt-get install jq</code> under Ubuntu or <code type="inline">brew install jq</code> under macOS (for other operating systems <link target="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/">refer to the official JQ installation page</link>).</p>
<p>For example, to select and print the field <code type="inline">series</code> of your input <code type="inline">test.json</code>, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_29" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_29.txt"/></pre>
<p>Note: If you are using <code type="inline">jq</code> to look at your JSON data, you need to use the <code type="inline">--slurp</code> parameter whenever you want to treat the content of one or more JSON line files as a single array of JSON documents and apply some filters to it (e.g. to select and print only one document, use the following command <code type="inline">jq --slurp '.[-1]' test.json</code>). Otherwise <code type="inline">jq</code> will treat each document separately thus causing the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_30" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_30.txt"/></pre>
</div><div type="3" n="4.2"><head>A Note on Packaging Data</head>
<p>Depending one the total size of your data, it may be a good idea to store Passim input files as compressed archives. Passim supports several compression schemes like .gzip and .bzip2. Note that a compressed datastream will be slower to process than an uncompressed one, so using this option will only be beneficial if your data is large (i.e. gigabytes of text), if you have access to many computing cores, or have a limited amount of disk space.</p>
<p>This command (or, better, chain of commands) will output the first document in a bzip2-compressed JSON lines file (some fields have been truncated for the sake of readability):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_31" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_31.txt"/></pre>
<p>And will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_32" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_32.txt"/></pre>
</div><div type="3" n="4.3"><head>Custom JSON format</head>
<p>(Note: This subsection is not strictly necessary to run Passim, as the second case study will showcase. Nonetheless, these steps may be useful to readers with advanced needs with the regards to the format and structure of input data.)</p>
<p>There are cases where you may want to include additional information (i.e. JSON fields) in each input document, in addition to the required ones (<code type="inline">id</code>, <code type="inline">series</code>, <code type="inline">text</code>). As an example, when working with OCR data you may want to pass image coordinate information alongside the article text. Passim does support the use of input data that follow a custom JSON format as behind the scenes it relies on Spark to infer the structure of the input data (i.e. the JSON schema). Passim will not directly use these fields, but it will keep them in the produced output.</p>
<p>However, there may be cases where Spark fails to infer the correct structure of input data (e.g. by inferring a wrong data type for a given field). In these cases, you need to inform Passim about the correct schema of the input data. </p>
<p>The following example illustrates a step-by-step approach to troubleshooting this relatively rare situation where one needs to correct the inferred JSON schema. Passim comes with the command <code type="inline">json-df-schema</code>, which runs a (Python) script to infer the schema from any JSON input. The following steps are necessary to infer the structure from any JSON data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the necessary Python libraries.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_33" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_33.txt"/></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Extract an input example from one of our compressed input files.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_34" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_34.txt"/></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ask <code type="inline">json-df-schema</code> to infer the schema of our data from our sample file.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_35" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_35.txt"/></pre>
<p><code type="inline">json-df-schema</code> will try to guess the JSON schema of input data and output it to a file. The following example is what the schema generated by Passim (<code type="inline">Passim.schema.orig</code>) looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_36" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_36.txt"/></pre>
<p>Passim has failed to recognize the coordinate field as containing integer values and it has interpreted as a long data type.  At this point, we need to change the type of the sub-fields of <code type="inline">coords</code> (i.e. <code type="inline">h</code>, <code type="inline">w</code>, <code type="inline">x</code>, and <code type="inline">y</code>) from <code type="inline">"type": "long"</code> to <code type="inline">"type": "integer"</code>. This type mismatch needs to be fixed, otherwise Passim will treat <code type="inline">int</code> values as if they were <code type="inline">long</code>, thus potentially leading to issues or inconsistencies in the generated output.</p>
<p>We can now save the schema for later into a new file (<code type="inline">passim.schema</code>) for later use. This schema is needed when processing the input data provided for <link target="#case-study-2:-text-reuse-in-a-large-corpus-of-historical-newspapers">the second case study</link> presented in this lesson.</p>
</div></div><div type="2" n="5"><head>Running Passim</head>
<p>In this section we illustrate the usage of Passim with two separate case studies: 1) detecting Bible quotes in seventeent century texts and 2) detecting text reuse in a large corpus of historical newspapers. The first case study highlights some of the basics of using Passim,  while the second case study contains many details and best practices that would be helpful for a large-scale text reuse project.</p>
<p>In the following table, we build on the original Passim documentation and explain some of the more useful parameters that this library offers. The case studies do not require you to master these parameters, so feel free to skip directly to the <link target="#downloading-the-data">Downloading the Data</link> section and come back to this section once you are comfortable enough to use Passim on your own data.</p>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--n</code></td>
<td>5</td>
<td>N-gram order for text-reuse detection</td>
<td>N-grams are chains of words of length N. This setting allows you to decide what type of n-gram (unigram, bigram, trigram...) Passim should use when creating a list of possible text reuse candidates.<br/><br/>Setting this parameter to a lower value can help in the case of very noisy texts (i.e. when many words in a text are affected by one or more OCR errors). In fact, the longer the n-gram, the more likely it is to contain OCR mistakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--minDF</code> (<code type="inline">-l</code>)</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Lower limit on document frequency of n-grams used</td>
<td>Since n-grams are used in Passim to retrieve document candidate pairs, an n-gram occurring only once is not useful as it will retrieve only one document (and not a pair). For this reason <code type="inline">--minDF</code> defaults to <code type="inline">2</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--maxDF</code> (<code type="inline">-u</code>)</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>Upper limit on document frequency of n-grams used.</td>
<td>This parameter will filter out n-grams that are too common, thus occurring many times in a given document. <br/><br/>This value has an impact on the performances as it will reduce the number of document pairs retrieved by Passim that will need to be compared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--min-match</code> (<code type="inline">-m</code>)</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Minimum number of matching n-grams between two documents</td>
<td>This parameter allows you to decide how many n-grams must be found between two documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--relative-overlap</code> (<code type="inline">-o</code>)</td>
<td>0.8</td>
<td>Proportion that two different aligned passages from the same document must overlap to be clustered together, as measured on the longer passage <!-- TODO SH: Current mismatch between official doc and code, see what is going to be changed after David answers to this issue https://github.com/dasmiq/passim/issues/10 --></td>
<td>This parameter determines the degree of string similarity two passages need to have in order to be clustered together.<br/><br/>In the case of very noisy texts, it may be desirable to set this parameter to a  smaller value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code type="inline">--max-repeat</code> (<code type="inline">-r</code>)</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Maximum repeat of one series in a cluster</td>
<td>This paramter allows you to specify how much a given series can be present in a cluster.</td>

</div><div type="3" n="5.2"><head>Case study 1: Bible Quotes in Seventeenth Century Texts</head>
<p>In this first case study, we will look at text reuse using texts taken from <link target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-texts/eebo-tcp-early-english-books-online/">EEBO-TCP</link> Phase I, the publicly available keyed-in version of Early English Books Online provided by the Text Creation Partnership. This case study is a special case of text reuse, as we are not focusing at inter-authors text reuse, but rather at the influence a single book — in this case, the Bible in its published-in-1611 King James version — had on several authors. Can we detect what documents contain extracts from the Bible?</p>
<p>As this is a small-scale example of what an actual research question making use of text reuse methods could look like, we will only use some of the 25,368 works available in EEBO-TCP, taken randomly. This smaller selection size should also allow anyone reading this tutorial to run this example on their personal laptop. Ideally, we recommend using a corpus such as <link target="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/mind-bending-grammars/emma-corpus/">Early Modern Multiloquent Authors (EMMA)</link>, compiled by the University of Antwerp's <link target="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/mind-bending-grammars/">Mind Bending Grammars</link> project, should someone want to properly study the use of Bible quotes in seventeenth century texts. This corpus has the advantage of providing hand-curated metadata in an easily parseable format, allowing any researcher to focus on specific authors, periods, etc.</p>
<div type="4" n="5.2.1"><head>Extracting the Data</head>
<p>At the root of the newly-created directory is a JSON file: <code type="inline">passim_in.json</code>. This file contains all our data, in the format described above: one document per line (<code type="inline">text</code>), structured with the bare minimum of required metadata (<code type="inline">id</code>, <code type="inline">series</code>). As this is a small file, we encourage you to open the file using a text editor such as Notepad++ on Windows or Sublime on Linux/macOS to familiarise yourself with how the data is formatted. Because our case study focuses on the detection of Bible passages in several documents and not on text reuse within all documents, we have formatted the data so that the <code type="inline">series</code> field contains <code type="inline">bible</code> for the Bible (last line of our JSON file), and <code type="inline">not_bible</code> for all other documents. Passim does not analyse documents that belong to the same series, so this effectively tells the software to only compare all documents with the Bible — not with each other.</p>
<p>The <link target="https://github.com/impresso/PH-Passim-tutorial/">accompanying Github repository</link> contains a <link target="https://github.com/impresso/PH-Passim-tutorial/blob/master/eebo/code/main.py">Python script</link> to transform EEBO-TCP into the JSON format required by Passim and used in this lesson. We encourage the readers to reuse it and adapt it to their needs.</p>
</div><div type="4" n="5.2.2"><head>Running Passim</head>
<p>Create a directory where you want to store the output of Passim (we use <code type="inline">Passim_output_bible</code> but any name will work). If you decide to use the default <code type="inline">Passim_output_bible</code> directory, ensure you remove all of its content (i.e. pre-computed Passim output) either manually or by running <code type="inline">rm -r ./eebo/Passim_output_bible/*</code>.</p>
<p>As we will see in more detail in the second use case, Passim, through Spark, allows for many options. By default Java does not allocate much memory to its processes, and running Passim even on very little datasets will cause Passim to crash because of an <code type="inline">OutOfMemory</code> error — even if you have a machine with a lot of RAM. To avoid this,  when calling Passim we add some additional parameters that will tell Spark to use more RAM for its processes.</p>
<p>You are now ready to go forward with your first text reuse project. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Move to the sub-directory <code type="inline">eebo</code> by executing the command <code type="inline">cd eebo/</code>, starting from the directory where, earlier on, you cloned the repository <link target="https://github.com/impresso/PH-Passim-tutorial/"><code type="inline">PH-Passim-tutorial</code></link>.</p>

<p>Run the following command and go have a cup of your favorite hot beverage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_38" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_38.txt"/></pre>
<p>For now, do not worry about the additional arguments <code type="inline">SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS='--master local[12] --driver-memory 8G --executor-memory 4G'</code>; in the section <link target="#case-study-2:-text-reuse-in-a-large-corpus-of-historical-newspapers">"Case Study 2"</link> we will explain them in detail.</p>
<p>This test case takes approximatively eight minutes on a recent laptop with eight threads. You can also follow the progress of the detection at http://localhost:4040 — an interactive dashboard created by Spark (Note: the dashboard will shut down as soon as Passim has finished running).</p>
</div></div><div type="3" n="5.3"><head>Case study 2: Text Reuse in a large corpus of historical newspapers</head>
<p>The second case study is drawn from <link target="https://impresso-project.ch/">impresso</link>, a recent research project aimed at enabling critical text mining of newspaper archives with the implementation of a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives.</p>
<p>In this project, we use Passim to detect text reuse at scale. The extracted text reuse clusters are then integrated into the <link target="https://impresso-project.ch/app">impresso tool</link> in two ways. First, in the main article reading view users can readily see which portions of an article were reused by other articles in the corpus. Second, users can browse through all clusters in a dedicated page (currently more than 6 million), perform full-text searches on their contents, and filter the results according to a number of criteria (cluster size, time span covered, lexical overlap, etc.).</p>
<p>More generally, detecting text reuse in a large-scale newspaper corpus can be useful in many of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify (and possibly filter out) duplicated documents before performing further processing steps (e.g. topic modelling)</li>
<li>Study the virality and spread of news</li>
<li>Study information flows, both within and across national borders</li>
<li>to allow users discover which contents, within in their own collections, generated text reuse (e.g. famous political speeches, portions of national constitutions, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this case study we consider a tiny fraction of the <emph>impresso</emph> corpus, consisting of one year's worth of newspaper data (i.e. 1900) for a sample of four newspapers. The corpus contains 76 newspapers from Switzerland and Luxembourg, covering a time span of 200 years. The sample data necessary to run step by step this case study are contained in the folder <link target="https://github.com/impresso/PH-Passim-tutorial/tree/master/impresso"><code type="inline">impresso/</code></link>.</p>
<div type="4" n="5.3.1"><head>Data preparation</head>
<p>The format used in impresso to store newspapers data is slightly different from Passim's input format so we need a script to take care of transforming the former into the latter. While discussing how this script works goes well beyond the scope of this lesson, you can find the conversion script on the <link target="https://github.com/impresso/impresso-pycommons/blob/master/impresso_commons/text/rebuilder.py">impresso GitHub repository</link> should you be interested. The output of this script is one JSON line file per newspaper per year, compressed into a <code type="inline">.bz2</code> archive for the sake of efficient storage. Examples of this format can be found in the directory <code type="inline">impresso/data</code> and shown in the following example:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_39" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_39.txt"/></pre>
<p>Each newspaper archive is named after the newspaper identifier: for example, <code type="inline">GDL</code> stands for <emph>Gazette de Lausanne</emph>. In total, these four <code type="inline">.bz2</code> files contain 92,000 articles through Passim, corresponding to all articles published in 1900 in the four sampled newspapers.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not easy to inspect data packaged in this way. But some Bash commands like <code type="inline">bzcat</code> and <code type="inline">jq</code> can help us. For example, with the following chain of commands we can find out how many documents (newspaper articles) are contained in each of the input files by counting their IDs:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_40" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_40.txt"/></pre>
<p>And similarly, in all input files:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_41" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_41.txt"/></pre>
<p>What these commands do is to read the content of the <code type="inline">.bz2</code> file by means of <code type="inline">bzcat</code> and then <emph>pipe</emph> this content into <code type="inline">jq</code> which</p>
<ul>
<li>iterates through all docouments in the JSON line file</li>
<li>for each document it removes the <code type="inline">pages</code> field as it's not needed and selects only the <code type="inline">id</code> field</li>
<li>finally, with <code type="inline">length</code> <code type="inline">jq</code> computes the size of the list of IDs created by the previous expression</li>
</ul>
</div><div type="4" n="5.3.2"><head>Running Passim</head>
<p>To run the impresso data through Passim, execute the following command in a <code type="inline">Terminal</code> window:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_42" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_42.txt"/></pre>
<p>This command is made up of the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<hi rend="bold"><code type="inline">SPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS</code></hi> passes some configuration parameters to Spark, the library that takes care of parallel execution of processes.<ul>
<li><code type="inline">--master local[10]</code>: <code type="inline">local</code> means we are running Spark in single machine-mode; <code type="inline">[10]</code> specifies the number of workers (or threads, in this specific case) over which processes should be distributed (<code type="inline">local [*]</code> will make use of the maximum number of threads);  </li>
<li><code type="inline">--executor-memory 4G</code>: The equivalent of the maximum heap size when running a regular JAVA application. It's the amount of memory that Spark allocates to each executor.</li>
<li><code type="inline">--conf spark.local.dir=/scratch/matteo/spark-tmp/</code>: A directory where Spark stores temporary data. When working with large datasets, it is important to specify a location with sufficient free disk space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><hi rend="bold"><code type="inline">--schema-path</code></hi>: Specifies the path to the JSON schema describing the input data to be ran through Passim (see section <link target="#custom-json-format">"Custom JSON format"</link> for more information about how to generate such schema).</li>
<li><hi rend="bold"><code type="inline">impresso/data/*.jsonl.bz2</code></hi>: Specifies the input files (i.e. all files contained in <code type="inline">impresso/data/</code> with <code type="inline">.jsonl.bz2</code> in the file name);</li>
<li><hi rend="bold"><code type="inline">impresso/Passim-output/</code></hi>: Specifies where Passim should write its output</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to limit the processing to a couple of input files — for example to limit memory usage — you can specify the input using the following command:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_43" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_43.txt"/></pre>
<p>You can monitor Passim's progress while running by pointing your browser to the address <code type="inline">localhost:4040</code> where the Spark dashboard can be accessed (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><desc>Figure 2. Screenshot of the Spark dashboard while running Passim.</desc><graphic url="spark-dashboard.png"/></figure>
<p>Running Passim with eight workers (and 4 Gb of executor memory) takes about five minutes to process the 92,514 articles published in 1900 in the newspapers GDL, JDG, EXP, IMP (but your mileage may vary).</p>
<p>If you provide as input a folder with <code type="inline">*.bz2</code> files, ensure these files are not found within subdirectories or Passim will not be able to find them automatically.</p>
<p>It is important that the output folder where Passim will write its output is empty. Especially when running the first experiments and getting familiar with the software it can very easily happen to specify a non-empty output folder. Specifying a non-empty output folder usually leads to an error as Passim processes the folder content and does not simply overwrite it.</p>
</div><div type="4" n="5.3.3"><head>Inspecting Passim's Output</head>
<p>Once Passim has finished running, the output folder <code type="inline">impresso/Passim-output/</code> will contain a sub-folder <code type="inline">out.json/</code> with the extracted text reuse clusters. If you specified <code type="inline">--output=parquet</code> instead of <code type="inline">--output=json</code>, this sub-folder will be named <code type="inline">out.parquet</code>.</p>
<p>In the JSON output each document corresponds to a text reuse passage. Since passages are aggregated into clusters, each passage contains a field <code type="inline">cluster</code> with the ID of the cluster to which it belongs.</p>
<p>To obtain the total number of cluster, we can count the number of unique cluster IDs with the following one-line command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_44" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_44.txt"/></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can print the 100th cluster ID:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_45" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_45.txt"/></pre>
<p>And with a simple <code type="inline">jq</code> query we can print all passages belonging to this text reuse cluster:</p>
<pre><code xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_46" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_46.txt"/></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json" xml:id="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_47" type="block" corresp="code_detecting-text-reuse-with-passim_47.txt"/></pre>
<p>As you can see from the output above, this cluster contains the same piece of news — a mountain accident which happened in Interlaken on 30 July 1900 — reported by two different newspapers on the very same day with slightly different words.</p>
</div></div></div><div type="2" n="6"><head>Using Passim's Output</head>
<p>Since the usage of text reuse data ultimately depends on the research questions at hand — and there many possible applications of text reuse, as we have seen above — covering how to use Passim's output falls beyond the scope of this lesson.</p>
<p>Code that 'does something' with the data output by Passim can be written in many different programming languages. Extracted clusters can be used to deduplicate documents in a corpus, or even collate together multiple witnesses of the same text, but this will entirely depend on the research context and specific use case.</p>
<p>To given an example of where to go next, for those who want to manipulate and further analyse text reuse data in Python, we provide a Jupyter notebook (<link target="https://github.com/impresso/PH-passim-tutorial/blob/master/explore-passim-output.ipynb"><code type="inline">explore-Passim-output.ipynb</code></link>) that shows how to import Passim's JSON output into a <code type="inline">pandas.DataFrame</code> and how to analyse the distribution of text reuse clusters in both uses cases presented above. For readers that are not familair with the Python library <code type="inline">pandas</code>, the <emph>Programming Historian</emph> lesson written by Charlie Harper on <link target="/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh"><emph>Visualizing Data with Bokeh and Pandas</emph></link> is a nice (and required) introductory reading.</p>
<p>The code contained and explained in the notebook will produce the two plots of Figures 3 and 4, showing how the sizes of text reuse clusters are distributed in the impresso and Bible data respectively.</p>
<figure><desc>Figure 3. Distribution of text reuse cluster sizes in the impresso sample data.</desc><graphic url="plot-impresso.png"/></figure>
<figure><desc>Figure 4. Distribution of text reuse cluster sizes in the Bible sample data.</desc><graphic url="plot-bible.png"/></figure>
<p>As you can see from the plots, in both cases the majority of text reuse clusters contains at most two passages. In the impresso sample data, however, there is much more variance in the size of clusters, with 10% of them having a size comprised between 6 and 296 passages, as opposed to the Bible data where the maximum cluster size is 3.</p>
