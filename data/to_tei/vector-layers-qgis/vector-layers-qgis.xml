                <head>Lesson Goals</head>
                <p>In this lesson you will learn how to create vector layers based on
scanned historical maps. In <ref target="/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth">Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth</ref>
you used vector layers and created attributes in Google Earth. We will
be doing the same thing in this lesson, albeit at a more advanced level,
using QGIS software.</p>
                <p>Vector layers are, along with raster layers, one of the two basic types
of data structures that store data. Vector layers use the three basic
GIS features – lines, points, and polygons – to represent real-world
features in digital format. Points can be used to represent specific
locations, such as towns, buildings, events, etc. (the scale of your map
will determine what you represent as a point – in a map of a province, a
town would be a point, whereas in a map of a town, a building might be a
point). Lines can effectively represent features such as roads, canals,
railways, and so on. Polygons (effectively enclosed shapes with more
than a few sides) are used to represent more complex objects such as the
boundaries of a lake, country, or electoral riding (again, scale will
affect your choice – large buildings in a close-up map of a city might
be better represented as polygons than as points).</p>
                <p>In this lesson you will be creating shapefiles (which are a type of
vector data) to represent the historical development of communities and
roads in Prince Edward Island. Each shapefile can be created as one of
the three types of features: line, point, polygon (though these features
can't be mixed within a shapefile) . Each feature you create in a
shapefile has a corresponding set of attributes, which are stored in an
attribute table. You will create features and learn how to modify them,
which involves not only the visual creation of the three types of
features, but also the modification of their attributes. To do so, we
will use the files from <ref target="/lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</ref>
concerning Prince Edward Island.</p>

                <p>Open the file you saved at the end of <ref target="/lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding

                    <item>under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Raster Layer (alternatively the
same icon you see next to 'Add Raster Layer' can also be selected
from tool bar)</item>

                    <item>you will be prompted to define this layer's coordinate system. In
the Filter box search for '2291' then in the box below select

                    <item>If you are not prompted to define the layer's coordinate system, you
need to change a setting. Click Settings and then Options. Click CRS
on the right hand menu and then choose 'Prompt for CRS' from the
options below 'When a new layer is created, or when a layer is
loaded that has no CRS'. Click OK. Remove the Holland Map (right
click on it and click Remove) and try adding it again. This time you
should be prompted for a CRS and you can select the NAD83 option
(see above).</item>

                <p>In previous steps you have selected and unselected layers in the Layers
window by checking and unchecking the boxes next to them. These layers
are organized in descending order of visibility – i.e. the layer at the
top is the top layer in your viewer window (provided it is selected).
You can drag the layers up and down in the Layer window to change the
order in which they will be visible on your viewing window. The
coastline_polygon raster layer is currently not visible because it is
below the PEI_HollandMap1798 and PEI_Cummins1927 layers. In general it
is best to keep vector layers above the raster layers.</p>
                <p>Uncheck PEI_Cummins1927 so that the only layer you have remaining is
PEI_HollandMap1798. Note that the map appears crooked on the screen;
this is because it has already been georeferenced by the lesson writers
to match the GIS vector layers. Learn more about georeferencing in
<ref target="/lessons/georeferencing-qgis">Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0</ref>.</p>

extreme accuracy is not necessary).</item>

just as you did with Lot 38. At the coastline you will notice that
you have a collection of lines to trace around Savage Harbour. This
is where the Snapping features becomes helpful. As you work to trace
along the modern coastline it will significantly improve your
accuracy by snapping your clicks directly on top of the existing
line. The more clicks you make the more accurate it will be, but
keep in mind that for many HGIS purposes obtaining extreme accuracy
sometimes produces diminishing returns.</item>

                <p>In Google Earth there were limitations on the types of features,
attributes, and data provided by Google, and Google Earth did much of
the work for you. That is fine when you are learning or want to quickly
create maps. The advantage of using QGIS software to create new vector
layers is that you have a great deal of freedom and control over the
types of data you can use and the features and attributes that you can
create. This in turn means that you can create custom maps far beyond
what can be achieved in Google Earth or Google Maps Engine Lite. You
have seen this firsthand with the points, lines, and polygons vector
layers you learned how to create in this lesson. If you found data on,
for example, public health records in the 18th century, you could create
a new layer to work with what you already created showing the
distribution of typhoid outbreaks and see if there are correlations with
major roads and settlements. Moreover, GIS software allows you to not
only spatially represent and present data in much more sophisticated
ways, but to analyze and create new data in ways that aren't possible
otherwise.</p>
