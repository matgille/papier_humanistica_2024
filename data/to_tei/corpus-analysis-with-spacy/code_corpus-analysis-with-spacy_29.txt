If you'd like to review the output of this code as raw `.html`, you can download it [here](/assets/corpus-analysis-with-spacy/corpus-analysis-with-spacy-16.html) and open it with your browser. Here, spaCy has identified relationships between pronouns, verbs, nouns and other parts of speech in one sentence. For example, both "two" and "interesting" modify the noun "phenomena," and the pronoun "There" is an expletive filling the noun position before "are" without adding meaning to the sentence. 

Dependency parsing makes it easy to see how removing stopwords can impact spaCy's depiction of the grammatical structure of texts. Let's compare to a dependency parsing where stopwords are removed. To do so, we'll create a function to remove stopwords from the Doc object, create a new Doc object without stopwords, and extract the part-of-speech tokens from the same sentence in the same text. Then we'll create a visualization for the dependency parsing for the same sentence as above, this time without stopwords.
