                <p>This lesson demonstrates how to use the Python library spaCy for analysis of large collections of texts. This lesson details the process of using spaCy to enrich a corpus via lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Readers will learn how the linguistic annotations produced by spaCy can be analyzed to help researchers explore meaningful trends in language patterns across a set of texts.</p>

                <p>Say you have a big collection of texts. Maybe you've gathered speeches from the French Revolution, compiled a bunch of Amazon product reviews, or unearthed a collection of diary entries written during the first world war. In any of these cases, computational analysis can be a good way to compliment close reading of your corpus... but where should you start? </p>
                <p>One possible way to begin is with <ref target="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</ref>, an industrial-strength library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in <ref target="https://perma.cc/4GK2-5EEA">Python</ref>. spaCy is capable of processing large corpora, generating linguistic annotations including part-of-speech tags and named entities, as well as preparing texts for further machine classification. This lesson is a 'spaCy 101' of sorts, a primer for researchers who are new to spaCy and want to learn how it can be used for corpus analysis. It may also be useful for those who are curious about natural language processing tools in general, and how they can help us to answer humanities research questions. </p>

                    <head>Why Use spaCy for Corpus Analysis?</head>
                    <p>As the name implies, corpus analysis involves studying corpora, or large collections of documents. Typically, the documents in a corpus are representative of the group(s) a researcher is interested in studying, such as the writings of a specific author or genre. By analyzing these texts at scale, researchers can identify meaningful trends in the way language is used within the target group(s). </p>
                    <p>Though computational tools like spaCy can't read and comprehend the meaning of texts like humans do, they excel at 'parsing' (analyzing sentence structure) and 'tagging' (labeling) them. When researchers give spaCy a corpus, it will 'parse' every document in the collection, identifying the grammatical categories to which each word and phrase in each text most likely belongs. NLP Algorithms like spaCy use this information to generate lexico-grammatical tags that are of interest to researchers, such as lemmas (base words), part-of-speech tags and named entities (more on these in the <ref target="#part-of-speech-analysis">Part-of-Speech Analysis</ref> and <ref target="#named-entity-recognition">Named Entity Recognition</ref> sections below). Furthermore, computational tools like spaCy can perform these parsing and tagging processes much more quickly (in a matter of seconds or minutes) and on much larger corpora (hundreds, thousands, or even millions of texts) than human readers would be able to.</p>
                    <p>Though spaCy was designed for industrial use in software development, researchers also find it valuable for several reasons: </p>

                        <item>It uses <ref target="https://perma.cc/W8AD-4QSN">fast and accurate algorithms</ref> for text-processing tasks, which are kept up-to-date by the developers so it's efficient to run  </item>

                    </list>
                    <p>You may still be wondering: What is the value of extracting language data such as lemmas, part-of-speech tags, and named entities from a corpus? How can this data help researchers answer meaningful humanities research questions? To illustrate, let's look at the example corpus and questions developed for this lesson.</p>

                    <head>Dataset: Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers</head>
                    <p>The <ref target="https://perma.cc/WK67-MQ8A">Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (MICUSP)</ref> is a corpus of 829 high-scoring academic writing samples from students at the University of Michigan. The texts come from 16 disciplines and seven genres, all were written by senior undergraduate or graduate students and received an A-range score in a university course.<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_1"/> The texts and their metadata are publicly available on <ref target="https://perma.cc/WK67-MQ8A">MICUSP Simple</ref>, an online interface which allows users to search for texts by a range of fields (for example genre, discipline, student level, textual features) and conduct simple keyword analyses across disciplines and genres. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Metadata from the corpus is available to download in <code rend="inline">.csv</code> format. The text files can be retrieved through webscraping, a process explained further in Jeri Wieringa's <ref target="/en/lessons/retired/intro-to-beautiful-soup">Intro to BeautifulSoup lesson</ref>, a Programming Historian lesson which remains methodologically useful even if it has been retired due to changes to the scraped website.</p>
                    <p>Given its size and robust metadata, MICUSP has become a valuable tool for researchers seeking to study student writing computationally. Notably, Jack Hardy and Ute Römer<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_2"/> use MICUSP to study language features that indicate how student writing differs across disciplines. Laura Aull compares usages of stance markers across student genres<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_3"/>, and Sugene Kim highlights discrepancies between prescriptive grammar rules and actual language use in student work<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_4"/>. Like much corpus analysis research, these studies are predicated on the fact that computational analysis of language patterns — the discrete lexico-grammatical practices students employ in their writing — can yield insights into larger questions about academic writing. Given its value in discovering linguistic annotations, spaCy is well-poised to conduct this type of analysis on MICUSP data.</p>
                    <p>This lesson will explore a subset of documents from MICUSP: 67 Biology papers and 98 English papers. Writing samples in this select corpus belong to all seven MICUSP genres: Argumentative Essay, Creative Writing, Critique/Evaluation, Proposal, Report, Research Paper, and Response Paper. This select corpus <ref target="/assets/corpus-analysis-with-spacy/txt_files.zip">

The dataset has been culled from the larger corpus in order to investigate the differences between two distinct disciplines of academic writing (Biology and English). It is also a manageable size for the purposes of this lesson. </p>

                        <hi rend="bold">Quick note on corpus size and processing speed:</hi> spaCy is able to process jobs of up to 1 million characters, so it can be used to process the full MICUSP corpus, or other corpora containing hundreds or thousands of texts.  You are more than welcome to retrieve the entire MICUSP corpus with <ref target="https://perma.cc/75EV-XDBN">this webscraping code</ref> and using that dataset for the analysis. </p>

                    <head>Research Questions: Linguistic Differences Within Student Paper Genres and Disciplines</head>
                    <p>This lesson will describe how spaCy's utilities in <hi rend="bold">stopword removal,</hi>
                        <hi rend="bold">tokenization,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">lemmatization</hi> can assist in (and hinder) the preparation of student texts for analysis. You will learn how spaCy's ability to extract linguistic annotations such as <hi rend="bold">part-of-speech tags</hi> and <hi rend="bold">named entities</hi> can be used to compare conventions within subsets of a discursive community of interest. The lesson focuses on lexico-grammatical features that may indicate genre and disciplinary differences in academic writing. </p>
                    <p>The following research questions will be investigated:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">1: Do students use certain parts-of-speech more frequently in Biology texts versus English texts, and does this linguistic discrepancy signify differences in disciplinary conventions?</hi>
Prior research has shown that even when writing in the same genres, writers in the sciences follow different conventions than those in the humanities. Notably, academic writing in the sciences has been characterized as informational, descriptive, and procedural, while scholarly writing in the humanities is narrativized, evaluative, and situation-dependent (that is, focused on discussing a particular text or prompt)<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_5"/>. By deploying spaCy on the MICUSP texts, researchers can determine whether there are any significant differences between the part-of-speech tag frequencies in English and Biology texts. For example, we might expect students writing Biology texts to use more adjectives than those in the humanities, given their focus on description. Conversely, we might suspect English texts to contain more verbs and verb auxiliaries, indicating a more narrative structure. To test these hypotheses, you'll learn to analyze part-of-speech counts generated by spaCy, as well as to explore other part-of-speech count differences that could prompt further investigation. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">2: Do students use certain named entities more frequently in different academic genres, and do these varying word frequencies signify broader differences in genre conventions?</hi>
As with disciplinary differences, research has shown that different genres of writing have their own conventions and expectations. For example, explanatory genres such as research papers, proposals and reports tend to focus on description and explanation, whereas argumentative and critique-driven texts are driven by evaluations and arguments<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_6"/>. By deploying spaCy on the MICUSP texts, researchers can determine whether there are any significant differences between the named entity frequencies in texts within the seven different genres represented (Argumentative Essay, Creative Writing, Critique/Evaluation, Proposal, Report, Research Paper, and Response Paper). We may suspect that argumentative genres engage more with people or works of art, since these could be entities serving to support their arguments or as the subject of their critiques. Conversely, perhaps dates and numbers are more prevalent in evidence-heavy genres, such as research papers and proposals. To test these hypotheses, you'll learn to analyze the nouns and noun phrases spaCy has tagged as 'named entities.'</p>
                    <p>In addition to exploring the research questions above, this lesson will address how a dataset enriched by spaCy can be exported in a usable format for further machine learning tasks including <ref target="/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis#calculate-sentiment-for-a-paragraph">sentiment analysis</ref> or <ref target="/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet">topic modeling</ref>.</p>

                <p>After all necessary packages have been imported, it is time to upload the data for analysis with spaCy. Prior to running the code below, make sure the MICUSP text files you are going to analyze are saved to your local machine. </p>
                <p>Run the code below to select multiple files to upload from a local folder:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_1" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_1.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>When the cell has run, navigate to where you stored the MICUSP text files. Select all the files of interest and click Open. The text files should now be uploaded to your Google Colab session.</p>
                <p>Now we have files upon which we can perform analysis. To check what form of data we are working with, you can use the <code rend="inline">type()</code> function.</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_2" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_2.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>It should return that your files are contained in a dictionary, where keys are the filenames and values are the content of each file. </p>
                <p>Next, we’ll make the data easier to manage by inserting it into a pandas DataFrame. As the files are currently stored in a dictionary, use the <code rend="inline">DataFrame.from_dict()</code> function to append them to a new DataFrame:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_3" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_3.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Use the <code rend="inline">.head()</code> function to call the first five rows of the DataFrame and check that the filenames and text are present. You will also notice some strange characters at the start of each row of text; these are byte string characters (<code rend="inline">b'</code> or <code rend="inline">b"</code>) related to the encoding, and they will be removed below.</p>
                <p>This table shows the initial DataFrame with filenames and texts. These are the first five rows of the student text DataFrame, including columns for the title of each text and the body of each text, without column header names and with byte string characters at start of each line.</p>

                <p>From here, you can reset the index (the very first column of the DataFrame) so it is a true index, rather than the list of filenames. The filenames will become the first column and the texts become the second, making data wrangling easier later. </p>

                <p>If you've done any computational analysis before, you're likely familiar with the term 'cleaning', which covers a range of procedures such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword removal. Such procedures are used to standardize data and make it easier for computational tools to interpret it. In the next step, you will convert the uploaded files from byte strings into Unicode strings so that spaCy can process them and replace extra spaces with single spaces.</p>
                <p>First, you will notice that each text in your DataFrame starts with <code rend="inline">b'</code> or <code rend="inline">b"</code>. This indicates that the data has been read as 'byte strings', or strings which represent as sequence of bytes. <code rend="inline">'b"Hello"</code>, for example, corresponds to the sequence of bytes <code rend="inline">104, 101, 108, 108, 111</code>. To analyze the texts with spaCy, we need them to be Unicode strings, where the characters are individual letters. </p>
                <p>Converting from bytes to strings is a quick task using <code rend="inline">str.decode()</code>. Within the parentheses, we specify the encoding parameter, UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits) which guides the transformation from bytes to Unicode strings. For a more thorough breakdown of encoding in Python, <ref target="https://perma.cc/Z5M2-4EHC">check out this lesson</ref>.</p>

                <p>Further cleaning is not necessary before running running spaCy, and some common cleaning processes will, in fact, skew your results. For example, punctuation markers help spaCy parse grammatical structures and generate part-of-speech tags and dependency trees. Recent scholarship suggests that removing stopwords only superficially improves tasks like topic modeling, that retaining stopwords can support clustering and classification<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_8"/>. At a later stage of this lesson, you will learn to remove stopwords so you can compare its impact on spaCy results.</p>

                    <p>To use spaCy, the first step is to load one of spaCy's Trained Models and Pipelines which will be used to perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and other text enrichment tasks. A wide range of options are available (<ref target="https://perma.cc/UK2P-ZNM4">see the full list here</ref>), and they vary based on size and language. </p>
                    <p>We'll use <code rend="inline">en_core_web_sm</code>, which has been trained on written web texts. It may not perform as accurately as the those trained on medium and large English language models, but it will deliver results most efficiently. Once we've loaded <code rend="inline">en_core_web_sm</code>, we can check what actions it performs; <code rend="inline">parser</code>, <code rend="inline">tagger</code>, <code rend="inline">lemmatizer</code>, and <code rend="inline">ner</code>, should be among those listed.</p>

                    </ab>
                    <p>Now that the <code rend="inline">nlp</code> function is loaded, let's test out its capacities on a single sentence. Calling the <code rend="inline">nlp</code> function on a single sentence yields a Doc object. This object stores not only the original text, but also all of the linguistic annotations obtained when spaCy processed the text.</p>

                    </ab>
                    <p>Next we can call on the Doc object to get the information we're interested in. The command below loops through each token in a Doc object and prints each word in the text along with its corresponding part-of-speech:</p>

                    </quote>
                    <p>Let's try the same process on the student texts. As we'll be calling the NLP function on every text in the DataFrame, we should first define a function that runs <code rend="inline">nlp</code> on whatever input text is given. Functions are a useful way to store operations that will be run multiple times, reducing duplications and improving code readability. </p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_15" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_15.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>After the function is defined, use <code rend="inline">.apply()</code> to apply it to every cell in a given DataFrame column. In this case, <code rend="inline">nlp</code> will run on each cell in the <hi rend="bold">Text</hi> column of the <code rend="inline">final_paper_df</code> DataFrame, creating a Doc object from every student text. These Doc objects will be stored in a new column of the DataFrame called <hi rend="bold">Doc</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Running this function takes several minutes because spaCy is performing all the parsing and tagging tasks on each text. However, when it is complete, we can simply call on the resulting Doc objects to get parts-of-speech, named entities, and other information of interest, just as in the example of the sentence above. </p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_16" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_16.txt" rend="block"/>

                    <head>Tokenization</head>
                    <p>A critical first step spaCy performs is tokenization, or the segmentation of strings into individual words and punctuation markers. Tokenization enables spaCy to parse the grammatical structures of a text and identify characteristics of each word-like part-of-speech. </p>
                    <p>To retrieve a tokenized version of each text in the DataFrame, we'll write a function that iterates through any given Doc object and returns all functions found within it. This can be accomplished by simply putting a <code rend="inline">define</code> wrapper around a <code rend="inline">for</code> loop, similar to the one written above to retrieve the tokens and parts-of-speech from a single sentence.</p>
                    <ab>

                    </ab>
                    <p>However, there's a way to write the same function that makes the code more readable and efficient. This is called List Comprehension, and it involves condensing the <code rend="inline">for</code> loop into a single line of code and returning a list of tokens within each text it processes: </p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_18" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_18.txt" rend="block"/>

                        <p>spaCy facilitates two levels of part-of-speech tagging: coarse-grained tagging, which predicts the simple <ref target="https://perma.cc/49ER-GXVW">universal part-of-speech</ref> of each token in a text (such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb), and detailed tagging, which uses a larger, more fine-grained set of part-of-speech tags (for example 3rd person singular present verb). The part-of-speech tags used are determined by the English language model we use. In this case, we're using the small English model, and you can explore the differences between the models on <ref target="https://perma.cc/PC9E-HKHM">spaCy's website</ref>. </p>
                        <p>We can call the part-of-speech tags in the same way as the lemmas. Create a function to extract them from any given Doc object and apply the function to each Doc object in the DataFrame. The function we'll create will extract both the coarse- and fine-grained part-of-speech for each token (<code rend="inline">token.pos_</code> and <code rend="inline">token.tag_</code>, respectively).</p>

                        <p>We can create a list of the part-of-speech columns to review them further. The first (coarse-grained) tag corresponds to a generally recognizable part-of-speech such as a noun, adjective, or punctuation mark, while the second (fine-grained) category are a bit more difficult to decipher.</p>

                    <p>Now you can calculate the amount of times, on average, that each part-of-speech appears in Biology versus English papers. To do so, you use the <code rend="inline">.groupby()</code> and <code rend="inline">.mean()</code> functions to group all part-of-speech counts from the Biology texts together and calculate the mean usage of each part-of-speech, before doing the same for the English texts. The following code also rounds the counts to the nearest whole number:</p>

                    <p>Here we can examine the differences between average part-of-speech usage per genre. As suspected, Biology student papers use slightly more adjectives (235 per paper on average) than English student papers (209 per paper on average), while an even greater number of verbs (306) are used on average in English papers than in Biology papers (237). Another interesting contrast is in the <code rend="inline">NUM</code> tag: almost 50 more numbers are used in Biology papers, on average, than in English papers. Given the conventions of scientific research, this does makes sense; studies are much more frequently quantitative, incorporating lab measurements and statistical calculations. </p>
                    <p>We can visualize these differences using a bar graph:</p>

                    <p>Though admittedly a simple analysis, calculating part-of-speech frequency counts affirms prior studies which posit a correlation between lexico-grammatical features and disciplinary conventions, suggesting this application of spaCy can be adapted to serve other researchers' corpora and part-of-speech usage queries<ref type="footnotemark" target="#en_note_10"/>. </p>

Fine-grain tagging can be deployed in a similar loop to those above; but instead of retrieving the <code rend="inline">token.pos_</code> for each word, we call spaCy to retrieve the <code rend="inline">token.tag_</code>:</p>

                    <p>spaCy identifies around 50 fine-grained part-of-speech tags, of which ~20 are visible in the DataFrame above. The ellipses in the central column indicates further data which is not shown. Researchers can investigate trends in the average usage of any or all of them. For example, is there a difference in the average usage of past tense versus present tense verbs in English and Biology papers? Three fine-grained tags that could help with this analysis are <code rend="inline">VBD</code> (past tense verbs), <code rend="inline">VBP</code> (non third-person singular present tense verbs), and <code rend="inline">VBZ</code> (third-person singular present tense verbs).

                    <p>Graphing these annotations reveals a fairly even distribution of the usage of the three verb types in Biology papers. However, in English papers, an average of 130 third-person singular present tense verbs are used per paper, compared to around 40 of the other two categories. What these differences indicate about the genres is not immediately discernible, but it does indicate spaCy's value in identifying patterns of linguistic annotations for further exploration by computational and close-reading methods.</p>
                    <p>The analyses above are only a couple of many possible applications for part-of-speech tagging. Part-of-speech tagging is also useful for <ref target="https://perma.cc/QXH6-V6FF">research questions about sentence <emph>intent</emph>
                        </ref>: the meaning of a text changes depending on whether the past, present, or infinitive form of a particular verb is used. Equally useful for such tasks as word sense disambiguation and language translation, part-of-speech tagging is additionally a building block of named entity recognition, the focus of the analysis below.  </p>

                <head>Named Entity Analysis</head>
                <p>In this section, you'll use the named entity tags extracted from spaCy to investigate the second research question: <hi rend="bold">Do students use certain named entities more frequently in different academic genres, and does this signify differences in genre conventions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>To start, we'll create a new DataFrame with the text filenames, types (genres), and named entity words and tags:</p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_45" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_45.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Using the <code rend="inline">str.count</code> method, we can get counts of a specific named entity used in each text. Let's get the counts of the named entities of interest here (PERSON, ORG, DATE, and WORKS_OF_ART) and add them as new columns of the DataFrame. </p>
                <ab>
                    <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_46" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_46.txt" rend="block"/>
                </ab>
                <p>Reviewing the DataFrame now, our column headings define each paper's genre and four named entities (PERSON, ORG, DATE, and WORKS_OF_ART) of which spaCy will count usage: </p>

                <p>From here, we can compare the average usage of each named entity and plot across paper type.</p>

                    <desc>Figure 7: Bar chart depicting average use of Person, Location, Date, and Work of Art named entities across genres</desc>
                    <figDesc>Bar chart depicting average use of named entities across seven genres, with highest counts of PERSON and DATE tags across all genres, with more date tags used in proposals, research papers and creative writing papers and more person tags used in argumentative essays, critique/evaluations, reports and response papers.</figDesc>
                    <graphic url="or-en-corpus-analysis-with-spacy-07.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>As hypothesized at the start of this lesson: more dates and numbers are used in description-heavy proposals and research papers, while more people and works of art are referenced in arguments and critiques/evaluations. Both of these hypotheses are predicated on engaging with and assessing other scholarship. </p>
                <p>Interestingly, people and locations are used the most frequently on average across all genres, likely because these concepts often appear in citations. Overall, locations are most frequently invoked in proposals and reports. Though this should be investigated further through close reading, it does follow that these genres would use locations frequently because they are often grounded in real-world spaces in which events are being reported or imagined. </p>

                    <head>Analysis of <code rend="inline">DATE</code> Named Entities</head>
                    <p>Let's explore  patterns of one of these entities' usage (<code rend="inline">DATE</code>) further by retrieving the words most frequently tagged as dates in various genres. You'll do this by first creating functions to extract the words tagged as date entities in each document and adding the words to a new DataFrame column:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_47" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_47.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Now we can retrieve only the subset of papers that are in the proposal genre, get the top words that have been tagged as "dates" in these papers and append them to a list:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_48" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_48.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>spaCy outputs a list of the 10 words most-frequently labeled with the <code rend="inline">DATE</code> named entity tag in Proposal papers:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_49" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_49.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>The majority are standard 4-digit dates; though further analysis is certainly needed to confirm, these date entities seem to indicate citation references are occurring. This fits in with our expectations of the proposal genre, which requires references to prior scholarship to justify students' proposed claims.</p>
                    <p>Let's contrast this with the top <code rend="inline">DATE</code> entities in Critique/Evaluation papers:</p>
                    <ab>
                        <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_50" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_50.txt" rend="block"/>
                    </ab>
                    <p>Now, spaCy outputs a list of the 10 words most-frequently labeled with the <code rend="inline">DATE</code> named entity tag in Critique/Evaluation papers:</p>
                    <quote>
                        <ab>
                            <code xml:id="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_51" corresp="code_corpus-analysis-with-spacy_51.txt" rend="block"/>
                        </ab>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Here, only three of the most-frequently tagged <code rend="inline">DATE</code> entities are standard 4-digit dates, and the rest are noun references to relative dates or periods. This, too, may indicate genre conventions, such as the need to provide context and/or center an argument in relative space and time in evaluative work. Future research could analyze chains of named entities (and parts-of-speech) to get a better understanding of how these features together indicate larger rhetorical tactics.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>Through this lesson, we've gleaned more information about the grammatical makeup of a text corpus. Such information can be valuable to researchers who are seeking to understand differences between texts in their corpus: What types of named entities are most common across the corpus? How frequently are certain words used as nouns versus objects within individual texts and corpora? What may these frequencies reveal about the content or themes of the texts themselves?</p>
                <p>While we've covered the basics of spaCy in this lesson, it has other capacities, such as word vectorization and custom rule-based tagging, that are certainly worth exploring in more detail. This lesson's code can also be altered to work with custom feature sets. A great example of working with custom feaature sets is Susan Grunewald's and Andrew Janco's lesson, <ref target="/en/lessons/finding-places-world-historical-gazetteer#4-building-a-gazetteer">Finding Places in Text with the World Historical Gazetteer,</ref> in which spaCy is leveraged to identify place names of German prisoner of war camps in World War II memoirs, drawing on a historical gazetteer of camp names. </p>
                <p>spaCy is an equally helpful tool to explore texts without fully-formed research questions in mind. Exploring linguistic annotations can propel further research questions and guide the development of text-mining methods.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, this lesson has provided a foundation for corpus analysis with spaCy. Whether you wish to investigate language use in student papers, novels, or another large collection of texts, this code can be repurposed for your use.</p>
