#### Dependency Parsing
Closely related to part-of-speech tagging is 'dependency parsing', wherein spaCy identifies how different segments of a text are related to each other. Once the grammatical structure of each sentence is identified, visualizations can be created to show the connections between different words. Since we are working with large texts, our code will break down each text into sentences (spans) and then create dependency visualizers for each span. We can then visualize the span of once sentence at a time.
