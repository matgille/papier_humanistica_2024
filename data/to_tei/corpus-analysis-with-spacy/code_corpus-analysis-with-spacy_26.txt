Fortunately, spaCy has a built-in function called `explain` that can provide a short description of any tag of interest. If we try it on the tag `IN` using `spacy.explain("IN")`, the output reads `conjunction`, `subordinating` or `preposition`.

In some cases, you may want to get only a set of part-of-speech tags for further analysis, like all of the proper nouns. A function can be written to perform this task, extracting only words which have been fitted with the proper noun tag.
