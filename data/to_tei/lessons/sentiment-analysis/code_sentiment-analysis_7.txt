Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process. I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible. I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute. I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.
