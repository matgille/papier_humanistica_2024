Georeferenced map in satellite view.</desc><graphic url="mapwarper_satellite.png" alt="Screenshot of Map Warper's interface, with the scanned historical map of North Carolina and South Carolina overlaid onto a contemporary 'base layer' map of the same geographical region, at the same scale. At the upper left, there is a four-way navigation tool, and a slider-style zoom tool. At the upper right, there are icons including a marker point, a hand, and a four-way navigation arrow. A semi-opaque, information panel at upper right indicates that the base layer originates from Mapbox Satellite and the overlay is a warped map."></graphic></figure>
