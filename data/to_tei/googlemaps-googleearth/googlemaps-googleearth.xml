                <p>Google My Maps and Google Earth provide an easy way to start creating
digital maps. With a Google Account you can create and edit personal
maps by clicking on My Places.</p>
                <p>In My Maps you can choose between several different base maps
(including the standard satellite, terrain, or standard maps) and add
points, lines and polygons. It is also possible to import data from a
spreadsheet, if you have columns with geographical information (i.e.
longitudes and latitudes or place names). This automates a formerly
complex task known as geocoding. Not only is this one of the easiest
ways to begin plotting your historical data on a map, but it also has
the power of Google's search engine. As you read about unfamiliar places
in historical documents, journal articles or books, you can search for
them using Google Maps. It is then possible to mark numerous locations
and explore how they relate to each other geographically. Your personal
maps are saved by Google (in their cloud), meaning you can access them
from any computer with an internet connection. You can keep them private
or embed them in your website or blog. Finally, you can export your
points, lines, and polygons as KML files and open them in Google Earth
or Quantum GIS.</p>

Try searching the location of your current research project. You can
then click on the location and add it to your map by clicking 'add
to map'. This is the simplest method of adding points to your new
map. Try searching for some historical place names that no longer
exist (Ontario's Berlin or Constantinople). You will find mixed
results, where Google often identifies the correct location, but
also offers up incorrect alternatives. This is important to keep in
mind when creating spreadsheet, as it is normally better to use the
modern place names and avoid risking that Google with choose the
wrong Constantinople.</item>

                    <head>Creating Vector Layers</head>
                    <p>You can also create new map layers (known more formally
as vector layers). Vector layers are one of the main components of
digital mapping (including GIS). They are simply points, lines, or
polygons used to represent geographic features. Points can be used to
identify and label key locations, lines are often used for streets or
railroads, and polygons allow you to represent area (fields, buildings,
city wards, etc). They work the same in Google Maps as they do in GIS.
The big limitation is that you can only add limited information into the
database tables associated with the points, lines, or polygons. This is
a problem as you scale up your digital mapping research, but it is not a
problem when you are starting out. In Google Maps you can add a label, a
text description, and links to a website or photo. More information
about creating historical vectors in a full GIS is available in

Click on 'Untitled Layer' and rename it 'Layer 1â². Or you can create
another layer: click on the 'Add layer' button. This will add a new
'Untitled Layer' which you can name as 'Layer 2â². It should look
like this:</item>

use. At the bottom of the menu window, there is a line that says
'base map'. A base map is a map** depicting background reference
information such as roads, borders, landforms, etc. on top of which
layers containing different types of spatial information can be
placed. Google's Maps  allows you to choose from a variety of
base maps, depending on the kind of map you want to create.
Satellite imagery is becoming a standard form of base map, but it is
information-rich and may detract from the other map features you are
trying to highlight. Some simple alternatives include 'light
landmass', or even 'light political' if you require political
boundaries.</p>

                        <item>Like placemarks and lines, you can change the name and description
of a polygon. You can also change the colour and line width by
clicking on the icon to the right of your polygon name in the menu
box. Here you can also change the transparency, which is discussed
immediately below.</item>
                        <item>Note that the area bounded (i.e. inside) a polygon is shaded the
same colour as the polygon outline. You can change the opaqueness of
this shading by changing the 'transparency' which alters the extent
to which you can clearly see the background image (your base map).</item>

quotation marks.</item>
                        <item>Note: there is currently no way to set the

to eliminate the legend from the map that appears on your HTML site
you can do so by reducing the width if the &lt;iframe&gt; to 580 or
less.</item>
                        <item>You can also export the data as a KML file using the same dropdown menu. It will give you the
option to export the whole map or to select one layer in particular.
Try exporting the UK Global Fats layer as a KML layer. You'll be
able to import this data into other programs, including Google Earth
and Quantum GIS. This is an important feature, as it means you can
start working with digital maps using Google Map and still export
your work into a GIS database in the future.</item>
