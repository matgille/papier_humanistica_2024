One of your favorite parts of being a developer is actually working with users--you've got great communication skills. However, you are well aware of the stereotype that female devs are better at "soft skills" than programming. You're afraid of playing into that stereotype and of letting Ann down. You don't want to make it more difficult for her or any other women at the company by playing into a stereotype. You wish you could make a different choice, but don't know how to explain all of this to two people you barely know. Looks like you'll be working with Brad. 

After the meeting, Steve shows you to [[your desk]].
